This project is to develop an SMS spam classification system using Kaggle's [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset). 

The prediction problem here is predicting whether a given text message is spam or not spam. 

I started by creating a dummy baseline, and then apply CountVectorizer to the dataset, trained the pipeline, used RandomSearchCV to carry out hyperparameter optimization.
