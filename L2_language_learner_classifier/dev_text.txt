  A blonde walks into a New York City bank and asks for the loan officer. She says she is going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5000.The bank offer says he will need some kind of security for the loan, so the blonde hands over the keys to a brand new Porsche parked out the frond of the bank.  With the title and paper work all check out, the bank agrees to accept the car as security for the loan. The loan officer drivers the new Porsche into the bank's underground garage and parks it there.  Two weeks later the blonde retured, repays the $5000 she loand, and $15.40 interest that accumulated. The loan officer approaches the blonde and says,"We are very happy that this transaction has work out, but while you are away, i checkd you out, and  i'm a little puzzled. i found out that you are a multi-millionaire, What puzzle me is why you would bother to borrow $5000?"   The blonde replies, "Where else in New Youk city can park my car for two weeks for 15 bucks?".

Yesterday the British Foreign Minister rejected charges of his homosexuality. The scandal was made after the publications of his photo in British media. On this picture the minister takes a walk through London with his 25 years old adviser Christopher Myerson. Also there was information that they lived together in double room during the election campaign in the parliament of May. Besides, he didn’t agree with the idea that his “special” relations with Myerson had been a reason for Christopher’s appointment, noting high qualification of ex adviser.    According to the minister Myerson is very happily married. He said he wanted to have children but his wife had had several miscarriages, and it only united their family.

#=#=# Practicing talking about myself in English #=#=#Topic 1: About my job history - 3/3Oops, it's too long... I hope you aren't fed up with it.--------------------The next is the 3rd phase; I started working as a freelance training consultant. Since then, I have shifted my specialty from IT to human resource development training gradually, because most companies' requirement for training has been changed. I conducted various training such as leadership training, manager skill traning, training for new graduates/mid-career workers, and so on.  As a training consultant, I join a company at longest one year, so I work almost the same as regular employees. And what I do is, of course, it depends on each project, but basically it's simple.1st; look into current situation and requirement, and analyze training needs properly2nd, Plan, design and develop appropriate, effective and efficient training,or localize global/headquarters training3rd, deliver training effectivelyThe last, review and measure the effectiveness. According to those result, change something if it's needed. It's cycle.I conduct those roles with my team. So as a project manager, I do schedule management, budget control and so on.And the one of the most important things is that I discuss or negotiate with various departments or positions, such as managers, directors, CEO, ranks of employees, and people overseas on regular conference call or business trip, to develop as much appropriate training as possible.That’s it.*--------------------* new-graduate/mid-career workersWhat do you say "新入社員" and "中途（入社）社員" in English?"新入社員" is a new employee who just graduated from Univercity/college/school."中途（入社）社員" is a new employee who worked for other company and has much experience.*That’s it.I want to say "以上です".

I would like to write about my experience of traveling through India. I’ve been to India twice: first time in Goa for two weeks and second time in central India for three weeks. So, about my last trip I am going to write. Or rather I’ll translate my notes that I wrote down during the travel.Report one. Pushkar. 29th December.Now I am in the sacred town Pushkar. In spite of its size (the population is about 15 thousands people) this township is fairly good known in India. In the middle of the town is situated sacred lake, where pilgrims bath to pure their karma. Tourists bath as well to make some photos.This place is also famous for plenty of its temples. Local people told me that there are one thousand temples. I do not know how much true is in this fact, but there are really a lot of sacred places. The town is riddled with them and also it is said that on any tiny hill in the surroundings you can also find temple.We have settled in a very nice hotel with a good restaurant and very amusing staff. Everybody says to each other: “Hi du-u-ude!”, smoke hash and relaxing in a chill-out. Nobody hurry and everybody is happy.Five hours ago in this hotel I was deprived of my drug’s virginity. I drank milk shake with a good dose of marijuana (they call it special lassi). In five minutes my heart starts beating hardly and I was close to pass out. I was very scared and asked Oleg to go for restaurant chef, who was dubbed here as Doctor Aloon. He sat near me clapped my shoulder and said that there is nothing to scare about. He said that everything is normal, that I should relax and take a pleasure. Doctor also explained that in this condition people usually do yoga trainings, read mantra or bible. It calmed me down and I tried to relax. Almost straight away I had hallucinations. When I closed my eyes on the inner sides of eyelids as on the screen started different movies. And I was author of all this movies. I was like a genius film maker with a reach fantasy, who stores in his mighty memory thousands of forms and shapes. I was creating from these shapes new fabulous worlds. And every world was unique. And after two seconds I destroyed just created world to give life for new one.I do not know how much time I lied on a bed like a film maker but in some time movies slowly become not so bright and then disappeared at all. And I began to listen to some voices. It was like I come back to my childhood and I found myself in my old kindergarten. There were many different children voices, some screaming, clanging of tableware on the kitchen and so on.Then I slept a bit and woke up in two hours. After awake I was in normal condition and I go with Oleg to see the evening town.

I've been watcing that HBO TV mini-series for the last two weeks.All the time I was kept in the atmosphere of brotherhoodamong the fellas in the movie. Seing them sweating in thetraining camp, bleeding out when they were fighting on the battle field, struggling with cold in the foxholes, made me feel a deep respect to the Soldier and Human Being in general. Brave, yong, they have contributed their lifes to the country.I'm deeply moved by that movie.Actually, I watched a lot of movies about heroes and their lifes."The Pacific" is also a masterpiece. As long as the "Save Private Rian".I pray for peace in the entire world.

My father started to work in this hospital in 1976. Hospitals arent a nice place, but I have good memories with this one.When I was a child, the hospital was a places full of people and life, with lovely gardens everywhere. I didnt feel scary in it maybe because it doesnt look like a hospital. There used to be militars in it but when then the hospital started to be part of the spanish health sistem (instead of being a military place) and now there's no one left. Its an empty sad place.This hospital is now death, because of a bad administration, with lots of machines and materials going to waste when we need more hospitals in Spain. I only can wait and hope that someone really takes care of this stituation to rehab this extraordinary place that counts with 87.500 m2 of extension and 22 buildings, it used to have to his own church. The neighboord protests still continue untill someone give a logic destiny to this really special place.

A soft white rabbit was jumping happily in a forest. The ground, covered by flowers in bloom, remained listening his little feet resounding in the silence. There were no more sounds along the lonely forest and the bunny just kept jumping. He was completely focussed on his goal: find that peaceful green plain with a powerful waterfall where he found the thing. That dazzling strange thing that awakes his curiosity.Suddenly, the rabbit stopped. A persistent sound of water falling started to overcome his senses. The thing was just a few steps away...

        After graduating from a high school, many people want to enter a college school to continue study. There are many advantages for the students to enter a college.	First, in college we can specialize. Before entering a college, we have little opportunity to specialize a subject. For example, when we in the high school, we must focus on the primary subjects, these subjects are very important but everyone learns the same, everyone has no difference. But we may have different interests, so when we entered the college, we can choose what subject we want to learn, and we can focus on it. This gives us a chance to deeply research the subject.	Second, college life can let us stand on ourself’s own. College life is much different from the high school, we will leave with the parents even we may go aboard. In this reason, we must learn how to take care of ourselves. If we mastered this skill, it will be helpful in the future life. Also, we can meet many new friends in the college, especially the roommate. We will have more enjoyable time but also we may have to face the association problems in the daily life. To learn how to deal with people’s relationship is also a very important skill for us.	Finally, we may have more chance to get a better job, higher salaries by having a college diploma. Access to a diploma can make us more competent when we search jobs. Famous college’s diploma has more value. For examples, once we get a B.S. in economics, we can have a job in the financial companies, most of these companies have a higher payment for their stuff then other companies, also we can find in the government financial department. Have a financial diploma is necessary to get these jobs.  Employers want to employ those who have high-competence, for these people have more opportunity to create greater profit for them, and also the employers will pay more to these high-competence college students. So, a diploma will become an important thing in our career.	So, to get more knowledge, to face more friends, to practice our personal ability, to get more chance to have a better job, we need to attend college.

Hi everyone, I hope you take this into account because I am a really hardworking person who wants to improve her English no matter how many times she's told she's got a Chinese accent, her grammar is weak sometimes or whatsoever.It has always been for me an understandable thing whether I talk or write in an acceptable way. I just want to learn English in a natural way because what I've noticed about my English is that I tend to exaggerate everything I say and as a consequence I sound fake it seems...That's why I'm travelling to the States this year...when Dec arrives. I think It'll be the 13th like at 7 o' clock.It should be an awsome experience because Ive never been abroad and Im quite a little girl though Im 21...Im supposed to work in there and I dont even know how to cook or clean because everything I've wanted has been gioven to me froma very early period. So, as you may have noticed this is going to be quite an adventure for me. I am gonna miss a lot of people and think Ill be missed for some. I want to buy lots of things and have some short holidays...However it won't be possible as Ive come to accept. Ive decided to go to the States even though I could use that money in order for my sister to study something at some university or whatever institution for superior studies...This is not going to be easy.Definetely. I just know that I make a big effort so that I do not lose my job and...that I can send money to my family..because hard times will come and gotta be strong...God's gonna be there...

My first time writing in English.It is a mail for a potential job.I did my best, hope you can correct me!!!Thanks guys!In my opinion, what your client asks is that the game is culturally appropriate, that is to say that language, the vocabulary used must be consistent with the type of game (RPG, horror, sports ... ) and it takes into account the target: a young, adolescent, adult.The vocabulary, the language is completely different depending on whether you play Assassin's Creed or Animal Crossing.The choice of terms is crucial. A "fighter" is different from a "warrior". In France, the connotations behind these two words are strong, a fighter is a man (or woman), a soldier marching in campaign under the orders of a leader, he is part of an army. Instead, when we speak of a warrior other ideas are grafted to the vocabulary. Words such as respect, fear, ridicule, fighting, pride, anti-conformism, defense of ideals, code of honor ...You see the difference?In an RPG, the player identifies with the character. The fact that he can rename and use his real name is a clear proof of this desire for identification, both from the player and the part of developers.To go to the end of the adventure, the player must be motivated: it is the language that makes the bridge between the player and the image, which makes the real world.If the language rings false, the player can not submerge completely and leave for later, having failed to "enter" in this worldIt is not enough there is a cultural recognition, language does not betray the game We must put into the mouth of the character of words he could say. Asassin's Creed published in Germany: Ezio hungry. Will he ask to eat sauerkraut ?????We are in Italy at the time of Leonardo da Vinci, I doubt he can find tripe. The example is a bit much, I admit. But it's better to illustrate my point.The game is for players, it is necessary that players are attracted by the game They need a language attractive by his choice and his job.However, a game for a young target must not be too typed too childish or too complicated, a balance between the two: a language to create an emotional connection between game and player. As I've said in my previous mail, I'm playing since the age of 12 years.Since Tetris, Navy Seals on Atari computers, the saga of Final Fantasy (which I wait with impatience opus XIII), the Resident Evil saga, games online like Bitefight ... I do not know all the list. The latest one is Assassin's Creed, published by Ubisoft, a true gem.I also translate manga for almost 8 years, which gives me good experience in the choice of terms and especially in the levels of language figures as diverse as aristocrats or a rock band.I am also part of a reading committee for a publishing house, Editions du Petit Caveau, specializing in vampire novels and novellas.  I am also correcting for them. The next novel called Les LoupsKharkov by Alexis Lorens, was corrected by me.. Write a thematic guide to the use of novice translators in particular world of video games is an idea that appeals to me.

Tomorrow, one of our last actions for Japan will be organise, and I hope every persons who are suppose to help us will come. Since the march's earthquake, all the students in japanese of our school rallied to find funds for the Japanese Red Cross. And I'm very proud we managed to gather about 700 € in 3 weeks.Of course, as a student in japanese, I have participated to the collect. But I found it wasn't enough just to only do something in our school. So, the idea of a charitable forum reachable for everyone in our town grew up in our minds. It is very complicated to organise, and even if I have my exams soon, I really want to participate, it's really important for me. So, tomorrow we are supposed to meet us to share the tasks out. During that forum that we want to organise, we will propose japanese and origami lessons, and also maybe a calligraphy's workshop. For these lessons, we'll ask in exchange as money as people want to give us, then we'll send all to the Japanese Red Cross. I hope it will work and be useful, wholeheartedly.Mukeii.

So, my first post here I would like to write about amazing changes that happened in my life this year.As I finished school this year, I should continue my education in institute. This year it becomes impossible. Big queues, crowds of people, everebody is angry- all of this is a  consequence of Russian education reform.  Our government still preserve education free of any pay. Unfortunatly, I realized that it is a fairy tale. But in reality every free of charge position can be bought.But I still believe that I will enter the university/ institute, russian corruption wont be a problem on the way to my goals nd I will be lucky to say that I am a student of university!

Hey guess what?It's desided to go to Australia February next year. This time , I am going to Australia as a school program. So, only 15 people can attned the program. And fortunately, I passed a selection based on application forms and got a scholarship.All of people who passed an interview and the examination can get 100,000 yen,although they still need around 400,000 yen. Anyway,  I was really happy to hear that I could go abroad. By the way, I didn't plan to apply for this program to go to Australia until November because I would have to stay abroad for 5 weeks.This means that I'll lose a precious time. I am a college student. In my opinion , just college students have a lot of time to do whatever they want. Let's say, travelling , sleeping all day long, cycling, going skying,etc. Do you think elemntrary, junior high school and high school students can do whatever they want? Yeah, actually they can,but they act in a small area. Do you think people who work for some companies can have a long vacation?  Only a few of them can afford to do.So, what I want to tell is that this is the most precious time in a life.I should be careful spending the time and mony.I don't want to waste time and money.Anyhow, I can go to the country I've wanted to visit.I"ll enjoy a stay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hello everyone!well to me, Yoga is an experience involving body, mind, emotions and spirit.The Sanskrit word yoga means "to control" or "to unite". A good translation for this word would be “the experience of unity".Yoga first arose more than five thousand years ago in India. It grew from the need to develop an understanding of the various aspects of our experience in this life, from the physical through to the abstract. Throughout history it has proved as an invaluable tool for dealing with the various challenges of human existence.Outside India, the term yoga is typically associated with the so called: Hatha Yoga and its asanas (postures).  Yoga is believed to calm the nervous system and balance our body, mind, and spirit. It is thought by its practitioners to prevent specific diseases  by keeping the energy points open and  Prana (or life energy) flowing. Yoga has been used to lower blood pressure, it reduce stress, and it improves  coordination, flexibility, concentration, sleep, and digestion.  Yoga is usually practised in classes that range from 60 to 90 minutes in length (aprox). In a typical yoga class you'll practise the following principles: •First principle Asana (or body postures) it involves a set of twenty six poses, done at this temperature. This promotes profuse sweating, which is said to help the body rid of toxins. The temperature also promotes flexibility.•Second principle is Pranayama (or breathing control) this helps us achieve a calmer and more focused mind, and increases the energy level.•The third principle is Savasana (corpse/relaxing pose) y releasing tension in the muscles and putting our whole body at rest, you revitalise your nervous system, and if executed well, achieve inner peace making you feel relaxed.•And forth is Dhyana (or meditation) positive thinking and meditation will help remove negative thoughts and put your mind under control.After this... you feel totally refreshed. Ready to start a new day ;) Thanks for reading this! :D

Hello my dear friends.I want to tell you about the very interesting exposition, which I have seen in last weekend. This exposition was in one of the museum. This exposition was devoted to Salvador Dali, I never have seen his painting in the museum untill this moment. And I have knew  a littel about him. I was surprised his creativity. It's wonderfully, It's astonishingly. In his paintings there are many colours, there are many interesting ideas. Especially I have liked the series of his paintings about The deadly sins. In next weekend  I am going to go once more to this exposition, because in next Sunday there will be lecture about his life.

An English-speaking friend of yours has written to you asking for advice about renting a house in your country:-----------------------Dear Pat,How nice to hear from you! I'm very glad you've decided to stay a few months in my country.First of all, Have you chosen the town where you want to stay already?I suggest you choose Madrid rathen than a small town because it's easier to find a job here. Also, I live in Madrid and it will be easier for us to meet up!I agree with you about it's better to rent a flat or a room than to stay in a hotel. I think it would be a good idea to share a flat in the center of Madrid. Of course, the accommodations with a central location are more expensive but I really think that it's worth.You can find attached to this email a file with a lot of internet addresses to look for flats or rooms to rent in Madrid or other cities of Spain.Besides, I send you a doc with helpful information and advice about rental contracts. If I were you, I'd make sure that the flat is full furnished and you sign a contract with the owner of the flat.Of course, you can stay in my house while you find the accommodation without problem.I hope this information is useful. I look forward to hearing from you soon.Best wishes,---------------------Thanks a lot for your help!!

Title:Do you think it is easier to succeed nowadays than it was in the past?Along with the acceleration in rate of the modern society and the growth of the trend of globalization, the opportunities to achieve success in certain fields are widely believed to be increasing. Objectively speaking, I hold the perspective that it is easier to achieve success than it was in the past.Advanced policies in modern society enhance education opportunities for the public. The tendency of which sexual and racial discriminations are undergoing a decline enables a larger scale of people to obtain higher education. A general study conducted in 2007 indicates that the number of educated people in developing countries has increased steeply by a substantial percentage of 32.4% in the past 5 decades. The widely acknowledged perspective, which proved even more evidently by enormous facts nowadays, that a person’s education is the most crucial aspect of his or her life appears to be so extensive that people even equate success in life with level of education. It is authentic that education contributes directly to enhancing their job opportunities of promotion opportunities while improves self-condition when reaching for success. From that perspective, modern society provides superior conditions in educational for people to achieve success.Another convenience modern society brings for those who are seeking for success is its technological innovations. As stepping into the informational era, an era of extraordinary sophistication and versatility, we are experiencing the unprecedented rate of acceleration of technology which is turning what used to be mission-impossible into a simple matter of talent and willingness of hardworking, not concerning barriers in technique. Through a book-sized laptop can we easily obtain information from the very corners in the world within a blink of an eye, while by clicking fingers may we gain the latest statistics on a study from the other side of the globe. Telecommunications, Internet, and related cutting-edge technology are making it simpler and more convenient to do studies and achieve for success.Moreover, advance in technology also brings wider range of investment and career, which provides a larger scale for people to obtain achievements and more opportunities to enjoy success.We can cite the now common example of the extensive demands from the society towards the technicians of high caliber in the field of IT------ Information Technology. From this point of view, we can infer that modern society also provides a wider stage for people of high caliber to perform themselves.From what has been discussed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that it is undoubtedly easier to succeed nowadays than it was in the past because of the advantages modern society provides.

I haven’t practiced my English, this is too bad. But I have to practice; I try to think in English. Sometimes, when I’m walking around the street I remind all the things that I did during the day or the things that I want to do; in English, this is my daily practice.I’ve been busy with the schools and the period of tests; is awful! A lots of things to do, to study. This semester was good; I learned a lot of things and I visited many museums and galleries. I also made friends and this does the school-time more enjoyable. Next semester is going to be good. I’m going to have photography lessons; that’s very exciting! The bad new is that I must buy a camera and with the economical crisis, they are too expensive!. Anyway, this was a good year; that's a good start for the New Year.

I'd like to know if my usage of the word "original" is correct. The physical/mathematical theory that James Maxwell created in 1861 in order to explain electromagnetic phenomena was an original theory. That means, it was a new theory that didn't exist before Maxwell created it. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/originalThe theory was "new;  fresh;  inventive;  novel"It was "created,  undertaken,  or  presented  for  the  first  time:" in 1861.TIA!

The idea that most arthritis patients will prefer over Xylan appears to be an obvious result with the support of clinical studies about the preference of the drug, Xylan or Xenon, among patients suffering from the most extreme cases of arthritis. Nevertheless, the conclusion that Perkins Pharmaceuticals (PP) will be the most profitable company in ten years overlooks other factors affecting the profit. First of all, the fact that the patent of the Becton Pharmaceuticals (BP) expires in three years does not naturally point out that BP will not receive a profit any more. It is possible that BP would also manufacture the cheaper version of the drug and as a result BP would earn a profit because of its good reputation. In addition, it might be a possibility that BP would produce a new drug that could be more effective for the treatment of arthritis than any other drug. Until the arguer offers the information of BP's business strategies in the future, I remain unconvinced that BP would not be profitable.The studies in the argument are also unreliable. When evaluating the evidence of the clinical studies about the use of Xylan, a new drug curing arthritis, one needs to examine how representative the studies are. Could the most extreme arthritis patients represent all the arthritis patients? It might be the case that Xylan only has an effect on the most extreme patients and instead has little, even no, effect on other patients. One also needs to consider how large the sample is. If the number of patients studied is only a small portion, the result might be untenable--perhaps most other patients may prefer Xenon to Xylan. Moreover, one needs to take into account the procedure of the study. Is the question asked in the study misleading? Is the study conducted just by PP? Is the study limited to the arthritis patients of a certain hospital, even the same physician in charge? Alternative explanations could account for the study results and then could weaken the claim that PP will be the most profitable company in the next ten years. In addition, even if Xylan is popular among the arthritis patients, however, PP would not necessarily be a tremendously profitable company. After all, profit is determined by revenue and expense. Perhaps the arthritis patients would choose operation instead of drugs as the treatment method; or perhaps the arthritis patients in the survey just express their preference over Xylan and in fact they would not purchase Xylan because they might be highly concerned with the new drug's safety. For that matter, PP would not receive a profit in ten years. What is more, there is no information about the costs involved in manufacturing Xylan in the argument. Common sense informs us that usually producing a new drug needs new process, new equipments and new materials, which contributes to a high cost. Moreover, the arguer fails to consider the existing and potential competitors that would challenge PP's position.Finally, even assuming that PP would be profitable, the assumption that there are only two mutually exclusive choices, BP or PP, in the competition of becoming the most profitable company is unwarranted. Perhaps in the next ten years many other companies would earn a profit by producing not only newer but also more effective than PP.In sum, the argument appears logical at first glance, but actually it is unpersuasive. To bolster it the arguer must provide clearer information about the future business strategies of BP and the representativeness of the studies. To better evaluate the conclusion, I need to know PP's business condition. I also need to know what competition PP would face in the next ten years.

What is the most difficult when we learn foreign languages ? To me, it's listenning. I'm learning 2 foreign languages ; english and french language. I'm been studing them a long time ago but I always feel difficult, especailly to listen them.To learn both langauges, now I take the class of each language with each native teacher. The class's always funny and interasting but sometimes I cann't understand their words and it makes me so sad. My english teacher says always to all of students "Practice, Practice, Practice". I know I should practice but It's not easy to me, I think. In my case, actually, I feel nerverse and get embarrassed whenever I'm alone with native speaker. Because I'm worried about my poor conversation skills with a foreign language, for example, I'm not sure wheather I understand his words exactly or not. I think this is a big problem for me. To deal with this problem, I think I have to gain more confidences with a foreign language. I will try!!

I found a mobile phone software named 'healthy diary' and downloaded it just because of curiosity. Then I opened it and tried to find how to use it. After registration it reminded me to finish a test about my life style. The outcome was shocking that my condition is not good and need to change the life style immediately.I believe it is right. The outcome maybe sad somehow but from another angle, it is also an alarm for me. Knowing it is better than never. I think it is important to pay more attention to our own life. I hope my friends all live a healthy life!

I want to tell you about the dinosaurs exhibition I visited on Tuesday. I live in Kharkov and there is a very big square in the city centre. Some people say it's the biggest square in Europe. So, every summer something interesting is going on there. For example, last summer there was a so called 'sandy town' in the middle of our square where our citizens could see world-famous sights such as Eiffel Tower, Egyptian Pyramids, Coloseum, Parthenon etc. made of sand. Entrance was free. The only problem was that there were enormous queues.This summer they decided to place a dinosaurs exhibition on the square. The dinosaurs are life-sized and they are made of plastic or something like that. While you're looking around the exhibits you can hear the sounds they used to make - I think it sounds like chirping. I was amazed by the exhibition. It seemed as if I travelled in time. Also we could see a mammoth, a dwarf elefant and an animal that looked like a bear with a long tail but had a completely different name. The most interesting for me were the exhibits of primitive people - they were so short! If you ever happen to be in Ukraine, you definitely should visit Kharkov - you'll find a lot of interesting things there!

Hello everyone!If you are reading this I'm more than thankful for that.I haven't really been studying English but as I'm living in a English speaking country I came to learn it naturally. Of course I'm not saying I'm a native speaker, I'm far far away from that. I'm afraid my mother tongue which is Spanish influences my English a lot. I've found myself several times trying to say something the way I'd do it in Spanish, and as those languages are quite similar each other sometimes I trust too much in that deed trying to say a word I don't know in English using my Spanish vocab with a weird accent because maybe the word is similar in both languages, which sometimes works but most of the times it doesn't. Anyway, I believe that this site will help to train my brain to think the way a native English speaker would think. I've found myself really enjoying learning new languages because I believe languages are not only words or grammatical structures but a way to deliver your mind to people you wouldn't even imagine, and I came to realised that languages contain the culture and I'd go farther and say the heart, the passion and manners of the people. I'd like to encourage the people out there to learn a second and why not a third tongue as it is a great experience.

Hello! I would like fixing the english part...Thank you in advance :)In the beginning of the twentieth century, the young intellect who underwent a baptism of the modern thought began to lead a revolt against Confucian culture and 　advocate the rights of the Individual. However, It is very difficult for them to get rid of filial piety to mother. Because they were born and grow up in Chinese traditional family system, saw that their mother who restrained and suppressed by old restriction sacrificed herself to bring up themselves, therefore their gratitude to mother were extremely strong.In this paper the focus is on HuShi , and his suffering for conflict between his ideal and filial piety to his mother. He was one of leading and influential intellectuals during the New Culture Movement in China, promoted vernacular Chinese in literature, advocated the rights of the Individual and “Free love”. However, at the same time, he received mother's instruction, married Jiang Dong-xiu who had bound feet and illiterate. After all, HuShi can not get rid of filial piety through life, but in the limited condition, he makes an effort to approach the ideal even a little. We can see that such HuShi's keen desire is reflected in the image of mother in his autobiography“Sishi zishu ”.【日本語】胡適の結婚と『四十自述』の母親像二十世紀初頭、近代思想の洗礼を受けた若い知識人は、「個」の権利を主張し、儒教社会を打破しようと努力した。しかし旧社会の家庭に生まれた彼らは、自らの母が古い慣習に抑圧されながらも、多くの犠牲を払って自分を育てくれたのを見てきた。そのため母への感謝の気持ちは極めて強く、往々にして母に対する「孝」から脱却するのは難しかった。この論文では胡適と、彼の理想と母親への「孝」の葛藤に焦点を当てる。胡適は中国近代の新文化運動の中心人物であり、文学革命とともに「個」の解放、自由恋愛による家庭革命を主張した。しかしその最中、母の命により江冬秀と結婚している。彼女は纏足の文盲の女性であった。結局のところ、胡適は一生のあいだ「孝」の呪縛から脱せなかったのだが、限られた条件の中で少しでも理想に近づこうと努力したのだ。胡適の自伝『四十自述』に描かれた母親像には、そうした胡適の切実な思いが反映されているのである。

Hello Everyone, I have posted here a couple of times before, but just in Japanese, I decided to post now in English because it's been more than 2 years since I made the TOEFL exam, I got 583 points in the ITP version, since then I haven't taken any english classes and have been focusing only in Japanese, I'm pretty bad at it or maybe it's because it's a really different-difficult language to learn?, but I will keep going with it =). The problem is that I haven't been practicing English for a long time and I think I'm loosing fluency, if I had it someday, I'm pretty insecure mainly in grammar points, I think I have always been bad with grammar =(, the English I write/speak is just because I get used to it, but when I face up exercises where I need to find an "error" it's really difficult to me, almost impossible. I hope this Journal will keep me aware of my necessity for improving my English and to earn more vocabulary, and of course with your help, help me find those errors that I make and that I'm not aware of. Thank you very much! My mother tongue is Spanish, so any problem you have with it, I will be there for sure, Adios!

In Russia there are only two big cities: Moscow and SPB(St.Petersburg), these cities are under federal subordination and life there and others regions is very different. As a joke we say: "DC-1 and DC-2", it means DC-1 (default city) is Moscow, and DC-2 is SPB. If you see at some forum "Why today are a lot of traffic?" you may be sure it means about Moscow.

I watched a movie called "Before sunrise" today.It's not a new movie, but I haven't seen this movie.I think I used to tend to avoid watching romantic movies.But recently I have changed my mind.Anyway, that movie was pretty good. I really liked it.A guy who is travering in Europe met a Parisienne on the train.They talked about themselves, their experiences,their past, and what they want to do, what they want to be.And then they liked each other.However, they didn't have enough time, because he had to go back to US next morning.There was only one night they could be togethere.I wonder if I were in that situation, I don't know if I could make the decision that they made.I want to be a strong person but I don't think I am very successful so far...

Hello everybody,A few days ago, I've discovered something pretty awesome: it is called penmanship.It could be decribed as the art of writing. After much practice, the results are really great.I'd like to acquire this skill, however it doesn't really fit into my schedule right now. I'm still practicing a little bit every day.Well, I'll attend my exam within 8 weeks and a few days, but I've still many things to learn. That's what we call a challenge, so I find it quite interesting.By the way, I also keep a daily journal from sunday. That way I could keep a handwritten record of my days. It's always interesting to see change occure.I'd also like to tell to every japanese people to keep faith and stay optimistic during this crisis period.Have an interesting day.N.A.

Hi, there.This is the first time I write my journal here in Lang-8. I love writing my journal in English because I am able to organize my ideas while writing and also because I want my journal to be read as many people aspossible with a proper feedback or comment from natives. Through this process, my writing ability will be getting better and better, I believe.I hope to work globally in the future in the financial industry, which is now in big trouble, though. This is because I want to be familiar with finance, which is considered one of the most important literacies from now on both an individual and corporate point of view. In order for my dream to come true, I am currently preparing for studying in the U.S., majoring in finance. Some people working globally often say in his orher books that one should have strong skills which help the person survive a professional field. "Get out of comfortable zone" is my motto this year. I really know the fact that just a little more effort is important for us to seek a change toour life and then just continue what you believe makes a difference. I want to make friends with anyone who owns concrete mindsets."Opportunities are for those who are well-prepared."See you later

Do you know what the zeitgeist is? This is a term that has been used firstly in Germany by a philosopher J.G. Herder. And it has necessity of being rewritten endlessly like history because it is a kind of word that shows how we interpret that period. So you need to know the situation of the world as it is, to make your own globalized zeitgeist correctly. I also don’t want to use these words that make us (and this article) confused and completely boring. But I just want to introduce this important term and the facts that you would need for making your own values. I have known this term from watching a documentary movie named Zeitgeist that I want to tell about from now on. Here are only three introductions (somewhat changed by myself) of more in the movie.#1. – Religion.Do you believe in God or have religion? I do. But, I don’t believe church and the Bible. That is why I don’t go to church every Sunday, not because of drinking on every Saturday night. This is my own religion.  In my opinion, religions are inventions which are designed for making people in a society more clean and kind and for harmonizing them to each others. It is really good goal. But in many cases, the other goals happen. Sometimes the inventions are used for the completely opposite intentions of their infancy . For example, religions can justify horrible wars. Christianity helps this kind of wrong things to be hidden with their HOLY Bible that is a fake according to the docudrama. #2 – PossessionsWe all have to be free. But, if you feel free continuously without anything, you can even be almost enslaved . So, the thing is, to get actual freedom, we have to know more about what’s going on and have to pursue and find freedom constantly. It seems difficult. Coming to the topic, money makes us free. And also, it makes us enslaved even if we have a lot of it. That is because money is dept. The Bank doesn’t borrow money to us without profit. The docu-drama says that all the money supply on the market is always smaller than the money we have to pay back to the Bank. In other word, to pay back, some always should be bankrupt . Even if that is a story about U.S., nowadays U.S. economy is almost international thing. Who gets bankrupt? Or what nation gets?#3 – Venus projectThe docu-drama suggests and shows us a big project - building a new global society without money and oil - named Venus Project. And some people have already joined that project. They are arguing this is possible and we have that much of developed technology. The thing making it possible is technology and motivation rather than politics. I’m not worshiping this conspiracy theory  and I’m not suggesting you to join the project. I don’t know the documentary movie is true. But in the world, only 1 percent of the population owns 40 percent of the planet’s wealth. In every single day, 34,000 children die for poverty and preventable diseases. And 50 percent of the population lives with only two dollars a day. In fact, any volunteering services we can do and we do have been almost nothing or limited already. I also don’t know exactly why. But, “One thing is clear. Something is very wrong.” In the middle of this ugly moment we live in history, I think you need to have your own zeitgeist or values at least.I don’t know what I have to do also, but I’m going to do something to be someone. Because I believe I need to be somebody first to make myself do something valuable. You too, don’t waste your time, turn off TV, open your eyes to happening objective facts and find something you can do. Imagine all the people sharing all the world. Yes, it’s time to wake up to be realist, having a impossible dream in your heart, twenties!

I'm going to be bankrupt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But I couldn't stop buying for present.My friends always take care of me, but I have done nothing to them.And during wating my dad, I was in the coffee shop.I ordered iced mocha coffee and coffee for dad.A clerk couldn't understand my order.She counted only iced mocha.So I said again, but she didn't know what I said.I pointed at menu and emphasized that I want two coffees and one of them is JUST coffee.I couldn't explain anymore.Fortunately, she understanded.I have to study English more and more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I recently got news that the top model Daul Kim has commited suicide. Since she was my favorite model of all time, I was shocked and even suffered from terrible nightmare. I think the fashion industry has an expectant attitude with caring young models, especially with the ones who live on their owns. Models who always get much pressure on losing weight should have sorta pyschological mentors who can give them real advice.

Personally, I don’t think that increase the teachers’ salaries can improve the quality of education. Actually I don’t think there is a link between the salaries of teachers and the quality of education. A teacher’s salary can never influence the quality of education for the children!First and for most, teachers are the very people who teach students, the future of the world, knowledge. No matter how much money they get every month, they need to try their best to teach the kids good-qualified knowledge they knew. If they teach the students bad-qualified knowledge just because their low level of salaries, they must be recognized as immorality.Second, let’s think such a question that is “Where do the teachers’ salaries come from”. Maybe different countries have its own ways to give teachers money. But we have to know, no matter where the money come from, it is not from the kids, or we can say that the kids can not influence a teacher’s salary even by one dollar! In this case, how can a teacher express his or her anger about the low salaries by giving bad-qualified education to those innocent children?Some schools may give the teacher boundary if the students the teacher teaches get good scores, this kind of reward can improve the teachers’ enthusiasm, and probably that way may improve the quality of education by little. But I still think that teachers must try their best to teach the students and ignored the salaries they would get. Everyone have wishes, and most of us are greedy, especially in money. If you raise a teacher’s salaries, he or she may feel that is not enough instead feel satisfied. In conclusion, I don’t think that raising the salaries of teachers is the best way to improve the quality of education.

It isn't easy to explain when you feel lonely but sometimes everybody i think have felt that. I don't know why i feel lonely if i have a great family, good friends, i do my hobbies etc. I though that i have proved everything for feel good myself, although i have never had love!, this is the problem i think. In my opinion love it's a important thing of your live although your friends say sometimes it's a shit they told me that they had a girlfriend and they couldn't do nothing that they like to do, despite of fact that i would try news experience like love!. when i lack something for being happy it's when i'm in loneliness, it's terrible becuase you are sad and very negative. Loneliness it's silence like if you would be in a solitary gigant countrised , sitting near of big tree while i read a book and waiting for someone but sunset and fall the night it's cold and you don't have nobody give you hot. The first part of loneliness it's good but if loneliness extend more time the night will be terrible, dark, shadow, cold,so you feel lonely when it's night in the countryside.  definetly just the life.

Last week, I studied some of words in book, Northstar3. (I'm studying English listening and speaking third edition.) I'll talk about 'regional dialect'. Regional dialect is Sa-too-ry(사투리) in Korean. it was easy to understand. Because I was born in Busan and grew up in Busan. So I always say in regional dialect. And this is why the word,'regional dialect',was impressive to me. It is experienced to me.

I lived in Barcelona for 9 months. Now, I feel so lucky for that. I was living there because of a PhD scholarship. It has been one of the most wonderful experience I have had. Barcelona is the most cosmopolitan city I have meet. Barcelona is the capital of a provence with the same name. Its whole beauty it's well spread out over all the provence. This places worth a visit hence visitors should not only pass away: El Palacio de Mont-Juic, La Rambla de Flores, Plaza Espanya, y Plaza Catalunya, El Barrio Gótico, El Parc Guell, La Casa Batlló, LA SAGRADA FAMILIA, el Paseo Marítimo, el MAREMAGNUM, el Puerto Olímpico, La Pedrera, el Palacio de la Reina María Cristina, and so on.Going out of the city, Montserrat's Monastery it's worth a visit. Many people in Catalunya say that visit Catalunya without visit the Virgin Montserrat it is how if you haven't been in Catalunya. Believe me, it's worth a visit!Finally, I hope it would be useful to prepare your journey and you can fully enjoy one of the most beauty cities in Europa and oversea.

For example, I will (and must!) get all A's and a high record in TOEFL.I'm worried about the former more than the latter.Can I be admitted with two extra years?How difficult it become with the handicap? I'll ask the professor familiar with oversea education about this on next Wednesday.Anyway, I've started to learn English for TOEFL test.I'm feeling excited because of a high target. (Of course I know entering a school is not a goal.)So I'll try to write English diaries more often than ever.Thank you.

The sun was slowly bidding farewell to the valley of Argaan, a paradise in the skirts of the Asmadaar Mountain(1) range which was dotted with trees as well as thickets and blanketed with green grazing land much to the contentment of herbivorous mammals along with their predators.	A orange sky, clear of clouds, opened expansively until vanishing behind the peaks of the mountain range whose crests were shrouded with everlasting snow and whose foothills were carpeted with a dense forest, which made them almost impenetrable. In the heart of this valley subsisted Liinde'si, the southern outpost of the Jotari realm. No rightly a town, no even a village, just two buildings and three or four tents around a well, which granted shelter for a garrison of eight warriors and their families, as well as some few furs traders. Total population: 37. However, considering that Liinde'si was the only post in the area, there was a lot of transit of hunters, trappers and fur traders coming in and out.	“Hey Katain, can you please help me reaching the tree by the well so I can climb up?” Asked the young Asmaan to the warrior. Asmaan was a restless kid who has become the terror of the post, always getting in trouble by his out of control curiosity.	“And what business has a little kid with a tree he can't even climb by himself?” Teased Katain the troublesome pest.	“I want to have a better look at the sunset.” The kid responded quickly.	“And picking some fruits in the process, I guess.” Laughed Katain at the quick response.	“Well, what if I get some for you?” 	“Ok, we got a deal. Hope your mother don't get on me for doing this.” Katain lifted the lad and walking toward the lofty tree, assisted him in getting a lower branch. Seconds later the kid was lost in the abundant foliage and Katain went back to his post. The sun was already gone and the first shadows of the night visited the surroundings when Katain decided to check on the boy. When getting close to the well Katain spotted five strangers around the pond, pulling water out of the well. For the nature of the post it was not infrequent to see strangers at any given time. Or at least that was what Katain thought at seen those five characters. 	“Be welcome to our hospitality!” He saluted while nearing the strangers. That would be his last greeting. The five strangers turned around and at sighting Katain they just vanished in thin air. Katain had barely time to realize that those were not ordinary people but some eerie creatures, before his throat was slit from behind.	Asmaan's mother, who has been looking for the kid, witnessed the slaying and shrieked frightened. In seconds the entire garrison was around the well, weapons in hands, just in time to see how a creature stabbed her in her back. They charged outraged but didn't stand a chance against the heinous creatures, who only could be seen when it was too late. The manslaughter lasted five minutes and after that Liinde'si population dropped to one. That one being Asmaan who, from the tree, watched the whole massacre.

I want to write why I was interested in a month-long clinical clerkship in foreign countries such as the United States as follows. First, I want to understand the trait of Japan, the medical treatment level, the medicine field and problems in the put standpoint of Japan by the comparison with another country.Especially, I think that I will exert a big influence in the future by the thing absorbed in foreign countries in early life . Secondarily, I  think that I am able to build excellent communications with the patient after I  became a doctor by expanding view while attending school. I came to Japan at the age of five from Shanghai. Though I had been confused first in the country that I didn't understand the word and the culture, what obtained because I came to a different environment is very large. I think I have a better ability to adjust to a new environment compared with others. But I want to improve the communication ability more.I want to learn a lot by using this chance which is medical student's privilege.  For the reasons stated above, I was going to apply for this foreign exchange program . I would be very honored, if you could accept my application. Yours sincerely,

Wow!! I’m really excited! This weekend I went, with my wife and my two kids (they’re 19 months twins), to my parents-in-law’s second home in the countryside (it’s two hours driving from Barcelona). The idea was to be able to have a bit of rest (you know, grandparents help with the children) and also to work a little. So I brought my laptop but.... Oh no! In the rush preparing things to leave, I forgot my pendrive with all my work in my desktop!!! So what did I do? Well, fortunately I had the book I’m reading at present, and also my iPhone with the audiobook version: Deception Point, by Dan Brown.Oh my god, I can’t remember reading/listening so much in just two days!!!Friday afternoon, when we left Barcelona, I was in page 154. Sunday night, when we came back home, I was in the page 340. So almost 200 pages read in English and also almost 8 hours of audiobook listening!! I’m really happy!!!

Sometimes we hear: "This is unique person!" or "I never met man(woman) like you!" or "He is so ordinary" But if we will think about this from another point of view...I reached the following conclusions.Firstly, I think that there is no ordinary people. Because every person is unique. There is no person like this in the world! And you can gain expirience from communication with every individual you met. Will this expirience be good or bad for you... depends from YOU. But not from this person.Secondarly, there is no... unique people. If someone very important leave you then formed emptiness which must be filled with surroundings. World will form for you necessary combination to keep your life go on :) So meny people who told "I never can live without you" live without and feel very happy.

Currently I’m a member of the Civil Industrial Engineering program at the XXX  University , studying  my last semester which ends in December of the present year. At the time that I should chose a specialization of the career I opted to join the mention of energy and environment with some notion of how important it could be these issues in the following years. My suspicions were confirmed with the argentine gas supply crisis, the high prices of fossil fuels and high CO2 emissions from traditional power generation, which has made energy a priority issue for the economic, social and environmental development of the country.Since that time I have focused my career in the energy area, particularly in renewables energies, which presents a friendly alternative to the environment. Evidence of this was the realization of my professional practice in XXX, enterprise of solar energy projects located in Spain, one of the pioneering countries in the implementation of renewables energies such as wind and solar power. In addition, through my engineering thesis I continued my research in renewables energies and, particularly, in the feasibility of a large-scale solar power plant in Northern Interconnected System in Chile, topic that has so far not been addressed in our country.Your master`s program is an excellent opportunity to continue my improvement in this field, increasing my knowledge and improving my skills. Moreover, as international experience, it would be a instance to learn good practices and take new ideas. I addition,  your university is known as one of the best in the world, emphasizing its quality in the area of science and engineering and it has been highly recommended by my professors and others engineers that I have known.A master's course abroad would allow me to grow professionally and deliver me the opportunity to contribute to my country in the energetic development, with a focus on the matrix diversification and decreasing the dependency on fossil fuels. All of this under a sustainable stance, environmentally responsible and with a marked preference for non-conventional renewables energies.

hello, everyone!!! recently i've got a task to translate a text from my native language to english. well, i consider it the most difficult task and i'm definitely not good at it. i need it to sound as natural as possible. hope you'll help me^_^ there it isAfter rising for a number of years annual world military expenditure appears to have reached a peak in 1990. There are now grounds to expect expenditures to reduce with the subsequent improvements of international political climate. But today’s worldwide military expenditures still amount to more than 850 billion US dollars per year, and it is estimated as 1, 7 million US dollars per minute. More than 80% of that sum is spent on conventional weapons and armed forces. Conventional weapons make up the bulk of military expenditures even in nuclear-weapon states. On the whole developed countries are accounted for by about 80% of total military expenditures ratio around the globe.Because of the data lack worldwide military expenditures calculation is inevitably inaccurate. Moreover, there are some difficulties concerned with exchange national rates, military production system, the costing of military production (military output cost accounting) and civilian and military sector price pattern as well.  In 1980 UN General Assembly introduced a standardized reporting system to overcome this difficulty and subsequently recommended that Member states report annually to the UN Secretary General using this system. In 1988 UN Secretary General received data from 28 countries based on the reporting instrument. From 1987 on increasing political support of the effective integrated reporting system is embodied in General Assembly resolutions.

Hi everybody, I need some help. Actually I'm filling an application form in order to receive a scholarship from the Japanese government (monbusho), and as it's in English I'd like to make the less mistakes as possible, could you help me ?"The first reason why I want to study in Japan is to improve my language ability. In my opinion, understanding of the language is necessary to communicate with others and this is the first step to understanding one’s culture. On top of this, by improving my ability to read in Japanese, I will be able to learn from books about history, art,  and everything that is part of the Japanese civilization.""Studying history is something fascinating for me. It enables you to understand nowadays civilization and traditions, and how the arts, literature, technology evolved until now through the social context for different periods of time. Japanese history is a very interesting and vast subject I want to study in Japan.""Literature is something really important to me. Japan has great authors and philosophers and studying literature is a good way to understand the present social context of one's culture, to understand how to express thoughts and feelings, and to improve reading ability and vocabulary."Thanks.

Hello, everybody! Nice to meet you :)I need to write a short (less then 1400 chars)summary of my work about russian anthem. The whole is written in a different language. It's difficult to put everything into just a few sentences, so please help to me make it sound correctly.Thank you!National anthem of the Russian Federation – between the new state and the soviet traditionThe proposal of the Russian Federation president V. Putin to restore in 2000 as national anthem the melody composed by A. Aleksandrov, which previously was the anthem of the USSR, evoked a stormy debate about national symbols of the new state. Part of the society voted for the return to the old athem in order to keep the historical continuity, others opposed, calling in Stalin's crimes as their arguments. Soon after the melody was accepted along with new words. Current work aims to investigate opinion of Polish on russian government's contorversial move as well as to evaluate non-historical values of the old USSR anthem.The Soviet anthem melody undoubtedly complement the triad of Russia's national symbols – its coat of arms comes from the times of building the state by Ivan III and its flag appeared during reign of Peter the Great and Russian Empire's closing relation with the West. The respondents of survey I had conducted higly appreciated values of russian anthem's both music and words: most of people associated the anthem with strong and proud country along with hope for bright future. Comparison with the polish anthem revealed that part of respondents perceives it as out of date. Therefore it is possible that in near future Poland will face the same discussion about national symbols.

Hello, everyone.My name is Hotaru.I've just joined Lang-8. I'm trying to write diary in English.I live in Saitama, Japan.Saitama is near to Tokyo.Today, friends of mine and I went out for cherry blossom viewing at Senzoku-ike Park, Tokyo.Although most of blossom have fallen out, the park was full of blossom viewing people.Because it was warm (a bit hot) and not too windy, we had a comfortable blossom viewing party.In the evening, we visited Toriki, a bar which serves delicious chicken dishes in Hatanodai, Tokyo. This was the first time for me to visit the bar.Grilled chicken, fried chicken, rare-grilled chicken on salad... Every dish tasted very good.The most delicious dish was grilled chicken seasoned with salt and lemon. This was a dish of the day.I want to visit Toriki again.

I haven't bought lottey tickets at all.In the Middle Age, economy was controlled by religions that prohibits earning interest.Sometimes I suppose that there was a lottey in the Middle Age, and someone bought it. what happened?In my opinion, people included Priest may call whom buy lottery Satan. At last, they burnt to death.The background of lottery is that economy has become free from religion,and it has been developed as the rule of  society.The Korea national lottery called LOTTO has introduced in 2002.The catchphrase of advertisement was "To be rich, You can be rich"I haven't seen rich people who buy lottery,Usually people who buy lottery are not rich.Besides they have to pay 50% in tax.I think it's a kind of paradox. Government tell the people who are not rich to be rich, rather government become rich.

It is the first time that i come here, at a season when i want to leading a totally different life with before. i want to say goodbye to yesterday ,a time when i was ignored by the real heart of myself. i must step out of the other's influence and bless myself a sound tomorrow. i know its difficulties but i have to face all my heart and soul. You did not know me, did not know the struggle in my heart of whether living a common life or fly as i have dreamed for long. At the night, the night i decided to postpone my gre test. I used to see it as a sign of lacking courage, but mother told me:"it is a wisdom". I have never been wise in my life, i am too shy a girl to express my own ideas, i am too coy too communicate with others, all my thoughts have been denied before i can exhibit it , cause i am afraid, i can not wait others to deny me, so i have never been denied by any people besides me. This is a stone lying in the way,it stopped the pace of my growing, i know it is high time that i made necessary change. I need an outstanding gre grade, i am sure to make every efforts, i must keed up and i can.

Two different experiences in my life    With the progress of my growth, I lived in two main places, the countryside and the city. According to my observation in my memory, I noticed there were large differences between them.    Before my senior school period, I mainly lived in my hometown, a beautiful, quiet, small village, where the sky is always blue and the air is always fresh, no matter what season it is. For example, in spring, trees, flowers, grass, and even many kinds of animals begin to come to life. In common sense, it is trees that reflect the arrival of the spring firstly. They, sprouting, tell people that the spring is just around the corner. In summer, there will be a lot rain after which the frogs chirp loudly. In autumn, the crops will be ripe and the plants will be withered. So it is often said that the autumn’s coming will be known to all when one leaf falls. In winter, almost everything sleeps and will be covered by snows. At the time, all over the world is white from earth to sky. It is so clean that you can’t help going out of the house to appreciate the beauty of the nature. Above all, the villages are kind-hearted, simple, and unadorned.     However, just from my senior school period, I had to go out of my hometown and went downtown to attend school. On arriving to the city, I find there are more high buildings, more cars and broader roads, also many beautiful parks. However, no long later, I realize that there seems to be many disadvantages in the city, such as the noise from the factories and busy roads, the environment pollution, etc. More cars lead to more traffic problems. You have to spend more time to go to a place because of the heavy traffic. More seriously, more cars means more traffic accidents, more persons will lose their lives all by sudden. On the other hand, there are much more persons living in the city in terms of the countryside. Generally, more people bring about more pollution--- more garbage and waste water from people’s daily life.  Not only will it destroy the environment, but also it will take a lot of money to deal with them. There is few trees and less move of air, leading to the low quality air. Also, the noise can make people uncomfortable.     However, despite all above, there are many advantages. It has a higher living level, and more choices are supplied on goods or jobs. More importantly, there are many of high schools and universities where you can gain precious knowledge and valuable experience.     The two different experiences are both important for me, not only at the certain time, but in all my life. Neither of them will disappear from my memory and both of them will be precious experience, because each of them means a lot to me, not only is just a place where I have lived in.

The given two graphs illustrate the percentage of each source of energy used in America during the period of the 1980s and the 1990s. The sources are oil, natural gas, coal, hydroelectric power and nuclear power.As it can be observed from the first graph, in the 1980s, the source of energy used the most in the USA was oil, with 42 percent. Natural gas and coal accounted for 26%, 22% respectively. Compared to other sources, hydroelectric power and nuclear power were not used a lot.Turing to the next graph, there are some changes for 20 years. First of all, the percentage of oil as the source of energy decreased from 42% to 33%, on the other hand, coal’s percentage went up to 27% by 5%. In the case of nuclear power which was used a little bit in the 1980s, there is a twofold increase. There is almost no change on the percentage of natural gas.I'm preparing IELTS and I have difficulty taking IELTS test, especially writing. Thank you for helping me :)

Hello world, nice to meet you :)My acquaintance to English began when I was at the elementary school. I didn't like this subject at all, I thought "Oh dear, so boring..."But in one day I fell in BIG love (let me say that x) ) with the Beatles. I wanted to know more and more about them, and, in addition, I wanted to know what are they singing about. So, from that moment, I began to learn English seriously... and with pleasure :) Honestly, now I have some troubles with different aspects of the language. Prepositions and punctuation for example. Or TIMES - oh, they're really scarring me xD But I hope that here I will be able to improve my English - with a little help of my friends ;-)Also, few days ago I have started to learn Korean. Because of the music band too xD It's my karma, probably? :)

I have three children. My elder son is 29, my younger son is 25 and my youngest daughter is 21.I didn’t have good health when I was young, so I was not able to take enough care of my children. However my elder son instead of me took care of his brother and sister. When he was 8, his sister was a baby. He changed her diapers, gave her a bottle and held her in his arms or carried her on his back to sleep. That’s why, she used to watch TV sitting on his laps until she was big enough.Now, my elder son works in Hiroshima, my younger son is a doctoral student in Nagoya and my daughter is a university student in Tokyo.  Though each of my three children lives in each place far from our house, apparently they stay one another. I hope they continue having a good relationship forever.
