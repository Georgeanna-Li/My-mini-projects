I got up at six as well as other days.I turned my cell phone alarm off and left from my bedding.I thought it was colder than yesterday morning, and turned on the gas boiler.When I switched on my tv remote controller, I knew today is 1st,February. Gee.. It's already February. Why does time go too fast?I recalled my new years plan, and was disappointed with myself.I always make some plans, but hardly ever keep them. I thought I'm a lier. Aren't there good methods to keep my plans?Anyway I stopped thinking them, I went to work to make some money!Because I was so busy at work, time went so fast, and it was the time to leave my office.I went to "GangByun" subway station to take a train to "GangNam" station. there is an English academy that I'm attending to learn English.I studied English for 1 hour at it.I came back home, and searched on the internet to get good ways to improve my English skills. And finally I looked up this site. I hope to meet a lot people, learn many things, tell everyone something that I know.

Hi!Recently my parents have told me that they are planing to move to Seattle, so I`ve decided to improve my language skills.I`m not sure that if I was in english-speaking country I`ll understand all the words and phrases...And I`m still having problems with grammar...Actually,nobody knows about my parent`s plan and I`m quite scared of it...So, I guess, I need to talk about myself.My name is Liza and I`m 15 years old. I live in Russia, in Saint-Petersburg. It`s a really beautiful city, I love walking down his streets and watching his buildings and museums. Maybe it`s not that common, but I love some cultural things. I find them quite interesting.Well, I`m studing english for 8 year and I love this language. From the October 2009 I`ve started to learn Japanese... And for the 3 years I`m studing French. I`m still not so good at that language and I`m going to study it in the summer by myself.If you`re learning russian language I can help you. So you`re always welcome with questions!=D

Teacher is a kind of career which is respected by others. When we retrospect what we experienced during our studying in schools, we can easily find that teachers exactly play crucial roles in our everyday studying. Under my teachers’ help, I raise from an ignorant girl to a college student who are full of various knowledge. Teachers always patiently instruct knowledge to us; they not only own full of specialty knowledge but own passion that nutrient next generations.

My name is Nicolás, and in about 2 weeks, I'll go to Japan as an exchange student for a semester, classes are in in english, so I need to practice it a little more.Now, I'm sort of busy with the preparations for the flight (I mean, I should be way busier that I'm right now), but I already got the ticket, the visa, and I made the reservation for the hostel in which I'll stay a couple days; so, now I'm just preparing my luggage and some souvenirs from here (just in case).I'd like to practice my japanese as well, but I don't feel really confident with my current level. I can read hiragana and katakana (but sometimes I confuse some symbols and forget some others) and some kanjis. When I start the japanese lessons I'll start to write in japanese.Ok, that's it for now. I'm not really good at writing (I don't mean I write poorly, but I'm just not used to it- not evevn in spaish).

Nowdays,more and more Universities allow students to choose freely some teachers who are teaching us some courses.I think it is a good new way for us.We can have more choices to choose accorrding to our time,schedule and so on.I think it is very useful.When we choose this teacher, we often consisder if she or he teachse well,and if she or he is strict with students,and if she or he can give us a good atmosphere.So we can attend a best class.But I think there are some problems.First,we only get some informations about teachers from others and we don't konw if we adapt to her or his teaching.Second,we can't make sure we must choose it.Sometimes,we problely don't choose it.It makes us confused.So on students choosing lecturers should improve.

So, my first post here I would like to write about amazing changes that happened in my life this year.As I finished school this year, I should continue my education in institute. This year it becomes impossible. Big queues, crowds of people, everebody is angry- all of this is a  consequence of Russian education reform.  Our government still preserve education free of any pay. Unfortunatly, I realized that it is a fairy tale. But in reality every free of charge position can be bought.But I still believe that I will enter the university/ institute, russian corruption wont be a problem on the way to my goals nd I will be lucky to say that I am a student of university!

I lived in Barcelona for 9 months. Now, I feel so lucky for that. I was living there because of a PhD scholarship. It has been one of the most wonderful experience I have had. Barcelona is the most cosmopolitan city I have meet. Barcelona is the capital of a provence with the same name. Its whole beauty it's well spread out over all the provence. This places worth a visit hence visitors should not only pass away: El Palacio de Mont-Juic, La Rambla de Flores, Plaza Espanya, y Plaza Catalunya, El Barrio Gótico, El Parc Guell, La Casa Batlló, LA SAGRADA FAMILIA, el Paseo Marítimo, el MAREMAGNUM, el Puerto Olímpico, La Pedrera, el Palacio de la Reina María Cristina, and so on.Going out of the city, Montserrat's Monastery it's worth a visit. Many people in Catalunya say that visit Catalunya without visit the Virgin Montserrat it is how if you haven't been in Catalunya. Believe me, it's worth a visit!Finally, I hope it would be useful to prepare your journey and you can fully enjoy one of the most beauty cities in Europa and oversea.

Today, I want to talk about my favorite soccer player.My favorite soccer player is Raul who plays for Spanish La Liga club Real Madrid.Do you know him?He is known as one of the great strikers in this world. His play style is a little different from general great strikers. Actually, he is not so fast like Cristiano Ronaldo,Messi. And he dosen't have strong muscles. But he strikes a goal. I attributes the reason why he can get many goals to the motion before he receive a pass around the penalty area.  In that area, he moves very quickly and efficiently to shoot easily. Then the defender feels he has vanished. This motion is difficult to explain.Now he is 31. It seems old for a soccer player but he still has been a great striker. So I love his play and want to cheer him.

My Advanced English teacher demand me make a comparison between the movie Tangshan Earthquake and the text Hurricane Camille.    I hope my dear friends could help me check the grammar. Sincere thanks.The similarity: Firstly ,the two stories are concerned with disasters.  Secondly,the characters are members of a common family.Third, the stories are adaption from real accidents.The differences: Tangshan Earthquake is arounds a woman and her 2 children, it describes what happened on their family before the earthquake,during the earthquake and after the shock. Hurricane Camille is around a family and their friends how to fight against the hurricane, and the utmost courage and determination during the fighting.Secondly,   Tangshan Earthquake put emphasis on the lives of some particular people, and take audience into the movie's world through the characters' fieldof views.But the Hurricane Camille put emphasis on the main characters' mutual encouragement and their love to children.Thirdly, the theme of the Tangshan Earthquake is the relationship between familiy members and the comprehension between the two generations. The theme of the Hurricane Camille is signify the humanistic greatness and their faith in life.

Hi !Someone on this site was wondering why did people want to learn japanease.I thought that answer in english will make me practice and improve my english. Well, I'm a fan of learning foreign languages. I've tried all the languages proposed in highschool. First, I began with english. Then, I began italian but I couldn't have continued because it wasn't anymore in my highschool. After, I did german and spanish. I try to practice one a week. About japanease, I never had the idea to learn this language. I don't know Asia, it's a very unknow universe for me. I've never heard about their culture at school, it wasn't a language we could learn so I never wonder.Now, I'm a primary school teacher and in France we have got a list with the best literary books that we can study with the pupils. In this list there is the book called : "Cent onze haïkus" of Bashô. When I decided to work about poetry with my pupils, I chose to present this book. They had, at the end of the project, to produce one haïku, and, in visual arts I looked for their firstname in japanease. They did calligraphy to decorate their poem. Then I did a book with all their productions. Once, I fell on a site to learn japanease. It was a real undid for me to be able to understand the japanease signs. I'm very happy to have discovered this new language. I hope I will have japanease friends thanks to this site.

This is a very interesting topic to discuss, though it is very difficult to reach a consensus.In my opinion, at first step, we should give an exact and clear definition of the success and the life, for we can’t judge the importance of these two things without a limit. And then the different importance depends on our definitions of success, of life.I would like to divide people in two parts. One is so called “the person of their own”, like the holy man, the monks in India, the Taoists in China. They will only be interested in the self-satisfaction and pursue the inner harmoniousness. What is the good luck or the bad luck? These things mean nothing to them. However they will really pay much attention to the theological ability .The ability is rather more important than the good luck .Not only the monks, there also exist samples like them in the ordinary life, but very few. The other part are the people like most of us, “the social person” .The famous and important people like the political leaders are the best samples. These guys cannot live or achieve their life goals without a social environment. Of course, they also emphasize the importance of ability, but I think their great success are also the results of good luck, at least it is so to some degree. People often say that the good chance is for the ready people, but who gives the chance?  It is the good luck that gives them the chances to show their ability. There are so many smart and good guys like him in his country, why does he become the winner at last? There must be some good luck in the factors to explain his success, but in a key point, the good luck is often the determined one.

    What is hot in China? You will never ever have thought it will be this woman: Luo Yufeng. On internet we call her Sister Feng.     Sister Feng (凤姐), 1.46 meters high, graduated from a junior college, now works in a supermarket as a cashier in Shanghai. She professes that she read much since 9 years old and have reached the peak when 20. "From 300 years ago to 300 years after no one can surpass me." said Sister Feng. She distributed hundreds of thousands marriage-seeking leaflets in Shanghai subway station.     The extremely harsh requirements on the leaflet made her hot overnight. Her requirements, for example, the person must be a master of economics from Tsinghua or Peking University (the most famous in China) and as handsome as possible. He must be 25-28 years old, 176-183mm high and with no experience of making a woman pregnant. He must live in the costal city and have a good job and so on so forth.    Not only the netizens but all the normal people were extremely shocked by her. They think she is too funny and is just sarcasm. However, Sister Feng doesn't think so.     What does she think? Will she continue hot? Next time I'll continue. You can also search "www.baidu.com" and put 凤姐 in the blank for more information.

Long time no see! How are you people? I hope you all spend nice holiday!So, last time I posted a long article about a school work - Today I just want to update with a little note, something short, simple and nice. I still am learning foreign languages - this year I passed my English, Russian exams and I 'graduated' in Chinese course, because I had a year ahead my fellow students :) I don't claim my language skills are the best: I actually am far from perfection. As you can see, my English writing skills here are not perfect ^^ Also, I still have to work a lot in Russian, especially if I want to go to Moscow next year...Speaking about travelling, I am planning to go to London this coming September, for a week-end and with a friend. And I should be able to go to a friend's place in Florida, USA next spring. I just can't wait! <3I shall stop here, I have to sleep well this week-end, I don't want to look like a zombie at work o/ Please don't hesitate to point out any mistake, I really want my Engliosh to be perfect! And soon, I will try and write in Russian, as well.See you soon, guys, and get well!

I want to write why I was interested in a month-long clinical clerkship in foreign countries such as the United States as follows. First, I want to understand the trait of Japan, the medical treatment level, the medicine field and problems in the put standpoint of Japan by the comparison with another country.Especially, I think that I will exert a big influence in the future by the thing absorbed in foreign countries in early life . Secondarily, I  think that I am able to build excellent communications with the patient after I  became a doctor by expanding view while attending school. I came to Japan at the age of five from Shanghai. Though I had been confused first in the country that I didn't understand the word and the culture, what obtained because I came to a different environment is very large. I think I have a better ability to adjust to a new environment compared with others. But I want to improve the communication ability more.I want to learn a lot by using this chance which is medical student's privilege.  For the reasons stated above, I was going to apply for this foreign exchange program . I would be very honored, if you could accept my application. Yours sincerely,

I found a mobile phone software named 'healthy diary' and downloaded it just because of curiosity. Then I opened it and tried to find how to use it. After registration it reminded me to finish a test about my life style. The outcome was shocking that my condition is not good and need to change the life style immediately.I believe it is right. The outcome maybe sad somehow but from another angle, it is also an alarm for me. Knowing it is better than never. I think it is important to pay more attention to our own life. I hope my friends all live a healthy life!

John Forbes Nash Jr. He was one of the most excellent mathematician who took a Nobel Prize in economic by Nash’s equilibrium theory. The movie ‘Beautiful Mind’ shows the Nash’s dramatic life, from Nash entered the Princeton graduate school. John Nash is a schizophrenic. As any other schizophrenic, Nash also suffered from hallucinations. He couldn’t distinguish the real world and false world. In the movie, Nash thought that he had a great mission against the Soviet Union by analyzing the secret code word. However the mission was vision and all his behavior was unnecessary. As time goes on, Nash noticed that he has phantasm, and tried to overcome the situation. After all, he surmounted his mental disorder, and became the man who was upstanding all over the world. I was deeply moved by watching ‘Beautiful Mind’ especially, John Nash’s life. Sometimes, we envy the person who has a gift. In normal times, we are apt to ask someone’s IQ(intelligence quotient). And if he or she got a high IQ index, we feel envy of it. In short, we can easily understand that genius is happy. However, John Nash is not blissful. John seems to be pressed for time, achievement all days. He abhorred losing game. He doesn’t have any sense to hit it well with other student. Take a view of Nash’s life, I think John Nash is not only the person who has a super brain but also has highest patience and persistence. After Watching ‘Beautiful Mind’, I ask my mother who is a psychiatrist about schizophrenia. She told me that almost schizophrenics are prone to quit on life. Nash was subjected to humiliation all days. Yet Nash try to overcome his situation instead blame his life. Also I was really impressed about his affections for his wife. Of course without wife's effort, Nash couldn't got a huge honer. But I was more attracted to Nash's love style. In the last scene of the movie which Nash made a speech, I had goose bumps all over. He shows his gratitude to his wife, and gave me a great inspiration of love. Maybe John Nash was a gorgeous man and he will be remembered forever.From now on, I will never do not care for mental patient, and I truly help them for they win against all obstacles. Also I hope that society eliminate discrimination for metal patient.2009/10/5

This the summary of my internship report, could you please correct if anything is wrong please ? Thank you^^I have always been interested by the publishing companies so I decided to search for an internship in this field. I began to search in the manga publishing companies because that way I would be able to use my Japanese skills during my internship. I contacted several publishing companies and Taïfu Comics Publishing was ready to take me as an intern in their company.So my internship began at Taïfu Comics on the 2nd of November 2010 and lasted four months. The head office was situated at the 16th of Christophe Colomb Street in Sucy en Brie. My internship supervisors were Yves Huchez and his wife Véronique Huchez. They both explained to me the publishing process of mangas and the way the company was functioning.During my internship I had several missions, the main one was the proofreading of the translations of the mangas we received from the freelance translators that the company employed. I had to make sure that there were no grammatical or spelling mistakes and that the style was not too formal and that it matches the aimed audience. I also had to scan the mangas and to pass the files on to the computer graphics specialist. I was also in charge of regularly updating the website of the company. I had to create quizzes and write special features on several manga and post them on the website to keep the readers interested. Another of my tasks was to do some research on Japanese magazines to see what is the last chapter published in Japan for the mangas the company is currently publishing and to find if the authors of manga the company already published have written new mangas that could be interesting to publish in France. I also had to write press-cards containing information such as the title, the author, the genre and the summary of a manga. Those press-cards were given to the booksellers to help them know where to put the manga and how to organize them. Another of my missions was to prepare the mangas for the conventions on Japanese popular culture that Taïfu Comics is participating in.My internship finished on the 28th of February 2011. I am really grateful that Taïfu Comics Publishing took me as an intern. I feel that this was truly a great experience, rewarding from both the personal and professional points of view.

To prevent feeling guilty.I clarify this post is written after I had used 7 hours to study biology and mathematics.This is because I do not want anyone to use this reason which is "online" and claim that I never study .Now the time is 2.18am , I feel very tired and sleepy but I adhere to finish this post in order to release my stress and dissatisfaction.I have been in Pra-U more than one year .and I know STPM is just around the corner so I burned my time to study , escape every entertainment and set a timetable for myself in order to finish my syllabus revision .but TODAY , I received a very bad bad saying.I do not know this saying was a kind of motivation or just simply say out just want to make us to become more stress, or you want to compare our wisdom ?The teacher keeps saying we are not in revise progress ,no seriousness, asking question do not know how to answer , still very playful and so on I myself who really study seriously felt very depressed that what she had said to us When you're doing something wholeheartedly , suddenly someone come to scold you and blame you by saying some very ear-piercing words , I sure you will feel very discouraged .and she keeps comparing the lower six with us , saying the lower six students are more hardworking and serious than you guy ,theirs books are full with highlighting and note and bla bla bla ............. Why la ? The teachers do not understand what is the difference between the lower six and us, probably they are good but the teachers are not suppose to compare us with them , you are depressing your students and the students will feel inferior and remain the same or go some more worst That's why from earlier time , I had told myself that I never become the first in my life.See what happen now ? If you become the first , people will start to compare you with others and if you are not good enough ,people will criticize and try to pull you to the bottom , and what is your feeling ?and now the condition is the same , we are first batch of Pra-U students , many things has not been settled , we are so busy with co-curriculum ,we have PBSM, R&D and games , everything is new . So, as the first batch ,we tend to organize by ourselves , even the teachers also had no idea with what they suppose to do .We plan everything nicely , try to work out the impossible and so on .and of course we never neglect our study but our results were not as good as the last batch which called Form six students with minor curriculum recently.come to ours , we have more burden, and the teachers ....................The teacher never realize that we have a lot of thing to do until everything is over may be not all of us involved but please understand us that how distraction we are ?and NOW , the lower six enter Pra-U so nicely without worrying , everything has been planned and settled .They just have to continue and make it more systematic.see..... how good they are !!!!of course , things will tell our mind that we should eliminate the bad thing and left the good thing belong us . We are first batch , everything are tested by us at first , use a lot of money to buy shirt buy baju korperat ,payment , and unnecessary .We are just a rat dissection , after being dissected , and throw away ...... how sad we are ? but no one is going to understand , no one is going to take compassion on us . the teachers like non-stop scolding us and just want us to leave the school as fast as possible . They just think that everyone were just the same , they think that we never appreciate their effort on teaching, purposely make discipline problem and so on .besides, the teachers tend to use the lower six to compare with us ,they embarrass us in front of lower six students, and we become a gossip topic among them .what I dislike the most was the teachers are not enjoying on teaching us .She always complain how bad attitude we are and compare the students who thought by her before she came to this school.I just want to say , you can not expect every students can get the good result ,how about the student who really work hard but still can not achieve a good result? Sometimes, if you think everything is possible ,why we have to study some more , we can just wait for the next second to see what happen to us ,it is possible that I will become a millionaire ,who knows ?I felt very sad and want to cry out when I heard the words that came out from her mouth.I do understand her feeling , she just want her students appreciate her effort ,I can see from her eyes.she compare our wisdom to some one who just said to her a few good word .How could you say this? do you really understand him? are you saying that we do not have wisdom ? we are stupid ? we do not have any knowledge ?I have told myself , if I become one of a top student of STPM ,I will say this out to let them regret and prove that we are different ,and do not despise us . depressed .....

I am a French woman of 49 years old. I have been living in Marseille for about 10 years since 2000.I am now working In Paris which is not so far by train : only 3 hours. I live in Paris from Monday to Wedneday or Thrusday, and then I go back home.I have a good command in English reading, but a poor one in writing. I like speaking a lot, so even with a lot of mistakes I always try to speak in English with english speakers.I love learn new languages. Six years ago, I went to Italy. Without any knowledge at the beginning, after a fortnight, I could manage with italan people daily conversation, and understand many things. Italian is my preferred language because of Latin roots. It's for me a kind of very old French. And there a very interesting grammar with very funny tenses as for example subjunctivo. For me as a French speaker, it's quite an old-fashioned tense, but in Italian it has a daily use.Stop now with grammatical considerations ! Here I'd want to improve my english writing, to become fluent and be able to write a rich and correct english. I'd need it for job. Neverby, it's not the only reason. I like very much english too, and would be fluent.See you later

Dear Sirs,  We  would like to apologise for the repeated troubles of AAA manufactured by D co. at M co, and would like to report the result of the investigation by D co. along with our support proposal below. As stated in the report, regrettably the troubles that needed replacing its mother board have happened often since this model WS333 was released, however we judged that there is no concern for lot defect because there has not been such report so far from D co. quality assurance dept.after their investigation. Despite these inconvenient facts happened so far, its our policy to employ PC from D co. for AAA in our system because of their excellent global service network. For further details, attached please find the trouble report from D co. Japan.   For further troubles in future, we have the support organization by our subsidiary as follows and would like to request you to advise M co. that M co. contact Y co.  when something wrong happend in our system, We will support Y co. and take over them if Y co. does not work so well as customers expect.  As our proposal, we would like to suggest that M co.  go into the maintenance contract with the contact point below so as to prevent troubles in the whole system from happening.  Though the trouble rate may be higher for AAA product however, taking into account that a trouble happens overseas, we would like to recommend D co. because they have a global service network that supersedes any other manufacturers and they can solve troubles sooner. Even though we procure a AAA in Japan and transfer it overseas, D co.  can identify it by it’s unique tag no and we can take advantage of their guaranty system wherever the AAA is transferred in the world.Sincerely yours,

When I could saw you again it was really disturbing, but actually I like it. Saw that you didn't change much makes me feel like you are kind of pathetic, but a cute, sad and lonely pathetic. If you knew that I would like to help you so bad, maybe your silly acttitude to me will change, but I don't think that's gonna happen. I miss your smile, the way that you called me, all that we left in the pass. Someday I would like to see you better, see that you finally put the pieces togheter and you are happy. I think that's not gonna happen any soon, but the time exist for a reason. I miss you like a friend who cooks with me, watch some movie and cry, smoke a cigarrette and talk, talk about life or silly things.The last time I saw you I couldn't hyde that I wanted to cry because the confidence it is has gone. I wish you find the reason in yourself to keep moving, living and changing for better things, maybe for your soul

Well, this is something that I need to get off my chest and since everyone here have been really nice to me, I think this is the place to say it. Besides, I'd love to receive a little bit of feedback about what I'm going to say, and also, corrections because I'm never sure if my grammar is correct.The thing is that I've been feeling really sad and confused today. The reason? I basically lost my motivation to learn French.This isn't new for me, I've been feeling like this since March. I really don't know why, I find the classes really boring and annoying, also, the book we use in class doesn't help either. I can't concentrate enough and the only reason why I keep attending to my classes is because I like to be with my friends.At first, I thought I was having a hard time because we're learning a lot of heavy grammar, I tried to stay positive and forget about it, but now...Now I realized this isn't about the grammar or something like that. I remember that a few months ago my mom saw me studying Japanese in the kitchen and she noticed I was in a really good mood. I finished my homework a half an hour later and I started with my french homework and I instantly got frustrated, so my mom asked me what was wrong.I told her that french was giving me a hard time because of the grammar,the book wasn't good and my teacher was always asking us to do a lot of letters and I was running out of ideas. Besides, she criticized my letters because they were apparently "too long", so she told me to do shorter letters. When I started to do my letters a little bit shorter, she told me that they weren't good enough. So I basically didn't know what to do.Another thing is that, I'm already a Niveau B2 (Advanced) and I had to spend 5 hours per week in french classes, but I'm not going to take the international french exam this year because I'm going to Germany in September (Exchange/Au Pair program) and I'll be staying there until next year.My french teacher noticed I'm not the same person that I used to and she said that I'm not giving my best because I'm going to Germany and I don't need to study hard to the B2 test, but I think she's wrong, because I don't feel demotivated because I'm going to Germany and my head is focused on the german language, I FEEL DEMOTIVATED BECAUSE I FEEL THAT WAY! I'd be really worried if I had to take the test this year and I find myself in this terrible situation.She also says that I'm not paying enough attention to french because I started with japanese this year, and it makes me really anrgy because you have no idea of how much enjoy studying japanese. When I go to my japanese classes I feel very relaxed, no one is pushing me...My japanese teacher doesn't like to take traditional exams (he likes to ask random questions and if you don't answer them, he tells you to study harder) and he tells us that studying japanese is something that we should do because we like it and it's not an obligation. I personally feel the same way with German and French but it's not the same thing. I've been learning German since I was really little because I went to a German school and even though I love the language and the culture, I've always had to take it REALLY serious because it was a subject in school and I've always had the pressure of the international tests (I'm not saying that someone forced to take them, I did it because I wanted to, and I'M PROUD to have the certificates and everything but I still had pressure).Same thing with French, I started because I like the language and the culture but I've always studied for exams and that stuff.On the other hand, I study japanese for pleasure. I take it seriously and I study hard, but no one is pushing me to get ready for a test or anything. I enjoy studying all the languages I'm currently studying, but French is really killing me right now, and I can't quit because I'm extremely responsible and I'd feel guilty, since I'm almost two months away of leaving my country for a year (I won't study french in Germany)I've never felt this way before, I've had hard times with German too but not like thisSorry if this was too long and boring but I had to say it to someone and since a lot of people don't understand me when I try to talk about this and judge me, I really can't talk to them...Besides people are here to learn languages and I don't know, I thought this was the proper place to talk about this...Thanks for reading :-)

I spent a lot of time online such as watching many videos on YouTube, reading Wikipedia and blogs. Fortunately, it was Sunday, so doing that all day didn’t make any trouble for anyone.What a waste of time! I really hate that behavior, but I couldn’t stop that. At first, I felt they were interesting, so seeing it seemed to be a bit valuable to me. A few hours after seeing it, I became aware that they were useless information.I began to suspect that I am a bit addicted to the Internet. I usually have a lot of plan to do, so I don’t have time to be online long time. However, if I don’t have any specific plan like today, I tend to use my computer too much.I think I need some kind of restriction for stopping using computer.

In this day and age,the incidence of overweight children in developed countries hovering at a high level,many have became disturbed and alarmed.Some assert that fast food outlets should be responsible for this,while others opposite this view on the ground that they are parents who should be blamed.Personally,I deem that both sides has its merits and demerits.Granted,fast food outlets exert baneful influences on teenagers and utilizing various methods to impel youngster to buy their food for the sake of money.Firstly,these companies,by broadcasting misleading advertisements,fast food outlets send a message that eating fast food is good for your health to these immature children.Secondly,to meet the favor of the obesity teenagers,these outlets add too much fat and sugar in their food which is the chief culprit in obesity.According, without any self-discipline,it is standard practise for youngster to have these junk food all the day.However,it is erroneous if we fail to admit the negative effect exert by parents.To begin with,parents tend to be more busy with their work and care lees about their kids than a decade ago when there was few fat children.Consequently,children always eat alone without any guidance about what should eat,To fulfill their favor,obesity teenagers have a vast amount of junk food rather than health food(vegetables,cereals).Further,parents,most are unaware of the hazards of fast food,take their offsprings to fast food restaurants due to its convenience.Thus,with so many unhealthy meals,teenagers tend to be fatter and fatter.In final analysis,I concede that fast food outlets afford us these junk food exaggerating  teenagers' obesity problems to some extent.However,parents with little knowledge and less time spent with their children should also be responsible for this situation.On balance,I am convinced that both outlets and parents engender this healthy problem.

Nobody could have failed to notice the fact that drunken driving has been a grave problem with which we are confronted. Generally speaking, there are several reasons accounting for /behind this phenomenon. Firstly, recent decades have witnessed the rapid development of people’s living standards. As a result, cars gained ever-increasing popularity and have found their way into our everyday life. Secondly, people participate in more activities or banquets than ever before, where they will drink liquor/strong wine. Then, they may get drunk but continue to drive.　　Drunken driving is bound to generate severe consequence if we keep turning a blind eye to it. Firs and foremost, this behavior will directly threaten the safety of drivers, passengers and pedestrians/goers, resulting in traffic accidents, injuries and even deaths. Besides, treating the injured and repairing broken cars mean a grievous waste of money, time and resources. Last but not least, this irresponsible driving will make the road a nightmare, and thus, it will causes serious losses of faith in governments and the society.　　In view of the seriousness of this problem, effective measures must be taken before things get worse. First, it is essential that the supervisory role of laws and regulations should be strengthened to punish those performing drunken driving. Secondly, the public, especially drivers, should enhance their awareness of public safety. With stringent laws and alert public, it will only a matter of time for drunken driving to become things of past.

Everything was out of luck. But fate smiled at us.One day we were sitting with Nadya in the square in front of Kazan Cathedral, and remember our past failures and the work has not built any prospects. The benches in the square were empty and wet. There were few tourists. In November, the weather does not have to rest on the benches.  And it gets dark early in St Petersburg, at four o'clock already night. .- Good  evening... - suddenly sat down next to us an intelligent man. - What a evening? Four hours of the day - snapped at him Nadya, as he reason she did not like. - Good day ... - recovered from a stranger, but this time did not receive a reply. I wanted him to answer the greeting, but the man was sitting with Nadya`s hand, and was so impressed that he spoke with her, not me. - I you have already seen ... - he went to get acquainted with the Nadya of not paying attention to me. -  I saw you last summer in the garden.

Major in Teaching Chinese As A Foreign Language, it is my first time to be a tutor for a foreigner to help improve her Chinese. She doesn't know any of Chinese and it is hard for us two (yes, we have two tutors for one student) to teach her. What's more, though we have been professionally studying English for nearly two year, it is still hard for us to express exactly what we want to say in English, especially when we want to explain the questions she meets in learning Chinese. What a huge blow! My friend and I have decided to be more dedicated in English learning. I have given up French already. But for English, I love its beauty and don't want to give it up. So, work harder, girl!

I learned this wibesite from my friend, and I am excited to make friends from all of the world!And do you guys know the examination about TOEIC? I am thinking about taking it.

I'd like to know if my usage of the word "original" is correct. The physical/mathematical theory that James Maxwell created in 1861 in order to explain electromagnetic phenomena was an original theory. That means, it was a new theory that didn't exist before Maxwell created it. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/originalThe theory was "new;  fresh;  inventive;  novel"It was "created,  undertaken,  or  presented  for  the  first  time:" in 1861.TIA!

Hello there! I'm studying English now. I am not a person who were born in the country using English, but I really like English and want to improve my skills in everything about English. Please correct my writing from now on and conversate through this. :) Actually I'm not good at English as you see, much less in speaking, although interested in English. Especially I'm poor at speaking in more fluent expression. It doesn't come out of me easily though I'm continuing studing that in related text books. What do I have to do to improve speaking? And what kind of materials should I study to speak out high class ocabularies? Maybe there's no way but exercising, right? OK.

   TV shopping become one of modern means by which people do their shopping. Convenience is why it is popular , which is also controversial topic for consumers.   Some people accept TV shopping because it makes them shopping at home. They could choose goods what they need by TV Shopping advertisements. And they could pay a bill by remit money.    I do not like TV Shopping. Because there are too much frauds in TV Shopping. In TV Shopping advertisement the performance of their goods is usually exaggerated. The price of a simple thing is usually quite expensive. The after-sale of TV Shopping usually bad, someone is even no.

Hi, it's the first time I've written here. And firstly I'd like to ask the question (acutally, I don't even know can you reply me or not, since I've not found this function yet).Yesterday I was at my teacher. She prepares me for taking IELTS exams. I'm going to take academic module.I was describing what was the article I am reading about. The speech was about sands and deserts, and I said the following sentence 'Overall, the article is about things of which the deserts consist.' But the teacher corrected me, she interrupted me saying that it's completely wrong and this structure of sentenses is just in 'russian-style'. She said, that most proper way of expressing that mind would be 'The article is about thing the deserts consist of'. But, I still have doubts as I acquainted with that form of sentenses (of which) much time ago, I saw the example of using certain word in lingvo online dictionary and noticed that construction. So, that sounded like 'We need to consider more particularly the facts of which those issues arise', where we can see the same 'of which' construction. In fact, she said it's understandable (I'm about ''The article is about things of which the deserts consist.'', but she added it's not correct sentense anyway, while my mate said it's okay but too formal and there is no mistake in this sentense.Well, I wonder, who's wrong: me, my teacher or lingvo?

Hello, world! :)Today I'll try to tell you about russian system of education. This theme is very close to me: i have graduated institute last year and going to enter a post graduate course.Russian system of education is being reformed nowadays: from our own system, we are coming to the Bolognese system. Let's start with russian original system.In Russia (and other in former soviet republics) we divided education into several main stages: elementary school, secondary school, higher school and then science degrees are coming.Elementary school consists of three or four forms (from first to fourth. Fourth one can be omitted ), secondary school consist of five forms (from fifth to ninth). I would say, higher school should be divided into two main part: two highest forms in schools and five or six years of institute (or university).After elementary school pupils are able to read, write, count. After secondary school pupils can do everything mentioned above, their math skills are hardened, they should know basic physics, chemistry, biology, at least one foreign language, geography, history and may be some basic philosophy. At this point pupil get high education.Many people stops at this point: high education is enough for life ;) Almost everyone in Russia graduates from high school.Higher school is much more difficult to enter and to graduate. So it was very prestigious to have higher education. Nowadays bribery prospers everywhere, so higher education lost most of its prestige. Nevertheless, after higher school you receive a title of a specialist. As a specialist you are considered to be able to solve difficult abstract and applied problems, to be skillful at your speciality, to be able to do economic forecast, concerning your projects. But in every institute or university students learn a wide range of sciences. For example, as an engineer (a programmer), I had to learn russian language (a bit), philosophy, an arrangement of semiconductor devices, theory of problems solving and many other thing, I don't really use in everyday work.Last term in higher school is almost totally devoted to a degree work. In this work you should propose some minor improvement of something already invented (can I say "being used"?).After higher school students can go for a higher academic degrees. In russian system these are "candidate of a science" and "doctor of a science". In brief, to become a candidate of a science, you have to compose existing things, ideas to a some new system, to archive a  solution of a fundamental problem. To become a doctor of a science, you have to propose something really new to the science (or convince everyone, that you proposed something new).Next time, I'll try to write something about novelties in russian education.P.S. I didn't expect, I would need a dictionary so many times.

With the development of the film industry, nowadays, people are facing more alternatives in a ticket office than ever before. Whether you should choose a movie that will make you laugh to tears, or to choose to a serious one that deals with the issue of global warming? As far as I’m concerned, the decisive factor should be whether you can learn something from it. This is for the following reasons.First of all, movies provide us chances to experience various life experience and life styles vividly that few other forms of mass media can compare. For most of us, we can only grow up in one family, have one mother and one father, doing one job and choosing one life style in our life time. Movies, however, make it possible for us to live a complete different life: the life of single mother, the hardship of being an entrepreneur, or even grow up in an exotic country! Thus, by watching a movie, you will obtain a new respect of life.Also, watching movies is an ideal way to learn about a different country. As for me, I am an economic major, who have always being curious about the cause of the financial crisis in 2008, and have a lot of puzzles in my heart. After watching a movie named “inside job”, my confusions are solved and I felt astonished by the truth the movie revealed. I can’t imagine how can I get to know all these facts about the American from China, if it were not for the movie. Some people may argue that movies are created to provide entertainment rather than education. Apparently, there is great truth in this statement. What is equally true, however, is that we don’t have to give up our right of recreation, while learning something from the movie. Kids can be amused by KongFu Panda’s funny movements, but that doesn’t prevent them from learning something about Chinese Culture. Teenagers can get into rapture when High School Musical shows on the screen, but that doesn’t stop them gain a feeling of what friendship is all about. Adults can enjoy the visual concussion of the Avatar, but it doesn’t conceal the fact that they also feel the urge to respect the nature. Compare with those movies which offer mere entertainment, the movies mentioned above are superior in more ways than one. Some friends of mine are movies fanatic, and they are forever talking about how gorgeous the actress is or how rare is that emerald in the movie. I always shrug my shoulder when I hear any of these. To me, these movies are just trying to impress audience by providing them false picture of reality and are basically meaningless. Why people would let go such a great opportunity to be educated while experiencing great amount of relaxation at the same time, is beyond me. Hence, I’m deeply convinced that people should only watch movies that teach us something about real life.

If the entry's too long don't correct everything, just correct a few paragraphs or give me some useful tip.Some weeks ago the Starcraft beta was released by Blizzard, apparently you had to sign in with your Battle.net account in order to recieve some validation key.I waited cause I know people were gonna crack it, and so they did.I thought I wasn't gonna be able to run cause I only have an onboard graphics card, but it came out nicely.My thoughts about it:When I started playing a map came up right away, and a race was assigned randomly, on my first try the Zerg came up. They changed almost everything about them, most upgrades, most units and most buildings were changed.For example the Queen now is a land unit instead of an air unit (wtf) the Hydralisk is an advanced unit and the Ultralisk is way tougher.On the second try the Protoss came out. Most of their structures remain the same but their air units are all different, the Carrier seems to stay unchanged though. Dark templars are here but they don't merge into the Dark Archon, instead they merge into a normal Archon just like the High Templars. The Dragoons have been removed, and damn the Arbiter was removed, that was one of my favorite units from the original Starcraft.I did hate one unit that was similar to the new Collossus but smaller, it seemed too "insectish" and it didn't look Protoss at all.I haven't tried the Terran out yet.In conclusion the game is still under development but I doubt the final version will be too different from the Beta, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed, but since I liked the original Starcraft so much I had asumed SC2 was gonna be worse.On my next entry I'm gonna talk about Diablo 3, and my expectations on that game.Thanks for your time.

I started to play guitar, on the beginning of last February. I bought an elegant black guitar of the, certainly not very well knowed mark : Blacksun. The begining was quite hard, as soon as i put my fingers on the board, i feel a sort of pain on them. I forced the pain, and after two weeks, the pain, vanished and my training could really start. The first song that i played, was the Godfather's tune, played on fingerstyle. I was very proud, and this first learnt song, gave me the desire to play more. I learned, some classical songs of the 80's, and since, i don't stopped :)On 8 months, we can say that i learned some guitar skill, now, i have to improve my level by playing others, a little bit more difficult, melodies. I'm now with game's songs with the interprets like Nobuo Uematsu, Masashi Hamazu who have done the songs of the well knowed saga : Final Fantasy.I'm doing my little work, and i'll do my best to master my level.SAD PS : My guitare was roughly broken last week, i'm still waiting the charpenter to fix it, but it seems that he'll take all his time.

Today I decided to make my hairs shorter, because I become look like an emo. Thus I called to the hairdresser salon and they agreed to cut my hair today. I don't know a certain hairdresser in this saloon, so I didn't know who will cut my hairs. I came to salon on time. I sited on chair and waited my specialist. Then she came. She was very glamorous and hot. Although her face wasn't so attractive to me, her grooming compensated this issue, Here in Novosibirsk, many people don't have a habit to be well-groomed. Small number of young girls visit solarium. And then she started to make her job. Since she started I noticed she is newbie. Her movings wasn't confident. Also I noticed she often touched me, her small cold fingers slided on my face and I liked it. And her legs very often cuddled to my knees and I liked it too. I really wanted her. I started to find a way to meet with her. But she was on a job and, probably, private talk with clients is banned. Then her scissors broke. Screw unscrewed and fell down. I think it is great shame for hairdresses. At the end, she dried my hairs and smudge some gel. I was satisfied my new haidress. I said her: "Ok, normal...(then I saw she was unhappy)..good", and smiled to her.   I payed 400 roubles(~$13) for this job. I asked her name. And she's name was Valeria. I don't know will I come to her again. But as girl, she very interested to me.

Shaya, ahoj! Děkuji moc! O Krasnojarsku - ovšem měl jsem na zřeteli "krásná". Ještě divná [tady je "weird" :)] věta "mít na zřeteli", ona je správná? Vzal jsem ji na slovnik.seznam.cz.  Mimochodem, prosím vás, nevíte, existuje li nějaký online slovník, kde bych jsem mohl seznat všechno o nějakém slove: množné číslo, skloňování, rod. Na www.pravidla.cz ně vždy je potřebná informace. Poslouchám ted' různé české pohádky a myslím že jsou moc nemilosrdný :) Ve červené karkulke - karkulka naplnila vlkové břicho velkými kameny a jsi zabil se, ve pohádce o zlatovlásce - Jiřík "skočil s koně a vrazil mu do boku meč, aby krkavčata měly co žrát". Ale Jiřík rozuměl co zvířata mluví, a tedy rozuměl svého koně, který, myslím že neměl radu byt zákuskem pro krkavčat :)) Ooooch, to je těžko psát v češtině :)

It's being like... eight years since I last studied English at highschool (or anywhere, now that I think about it). Thankfully, all this time I haven't stopped reading it on the internet, and listening to American and English television series.Around a month ago, I decided I'm gonna take the TOEFL exam on december. Not only because I want to know what my real level is, but also because I'm gonna need the results on april when I start asking for a scholarship for my postgraduate studies abroad. I started taking all the TOEFL and Proficiency tests I could find, and I'm glad to see my reading and listening comprehension are very high. I'm also quite confident about my speaking (although a little bit concerned about my pronunciation, but I'm gonna practice talking with a buddy), but the writing part of the exam gives me goosebumps.I can express myself properly, but can I do it using such complicated words and grammar to convince the examiners that I'm worth a 100+ in my ibT? I tend to write quite plain, it's not that I can't use some impressive vocabulary and phrasal verbs (lol), but I usually forget them. So... time for practice!I'm using Anki (it's a very useful software wich uses memory algorithm based on spaced repetition learning) with a vocabulary deck to learn/review some difficult and showy words, just in case ;).Now I know the body of athletes is lithe, that when I get my 100+ it'll be a momentous event, and that an argument that doesn't hold water is the way you translate the "hacer aguas" expression in spanish.Please be really extrict with my written expression, not only with the faults I commit, but also tell me how would you say anything that sounds weird. Thank you very much!!

Hey guess what?It's desided to go to Australia February next year. This time , I am going to Australia as a school program. So, only 15 people can attned the program. And fortunately, I passed a selection based on application forms and got a scholarship.All of people who passed an interview and the examination can get 100,000 yen,although they still need around 400,000 yen. Anyway,  I was really happy to hear that I could go abroad. By the way, I didn't plan to apply for this program to go to Australia until November because I would have to stay abroad for 5 weeks.This means that I'll lose a precious time. I am a college student. In my opinion , just college students have a lot of time to do whatever they want. Let's say, travelling , sleeping all day long, cycling, going skying,etc. Do you think elemntrary, junior high school and high school students can do whatever they want? Yeah, actually they can,but they act in a small area. Do you think people who work for some companies can have a long vacation?  Only a few of them can afford to do.So, what I want to tell is that this is the most precious time in a life.I should be careful spending the time and mony.I don't want to waste time and money.Anyhow, I can go to the country I've wanted to visit.I"ll enjoy a stay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

An English-speaking friend of yours has written to you asking for advice about renting a house in your country:-----------------------Dear Pat,How nice to hear from you! I'm very glad you've decided to stay a few months in my country.First of all, Have you chosen the town where you want to stay already?I suggest you choose Madrid rathen than a small town because it's easier to find a job here. Also, I live in Madrid and it will be easier for us to meet up!I agree with you about it's better to rent a flat or a room than to stay in a hotel. I think it would be a good idea to share a flat in the center of Madrid. Of course, the accommodations with a central location are more expensive but I really think that it's worth.You can find attached to this email a file with a lot of internet addresses to look for flats or rooms to rent in Madrid or other cities of Spain.Besides, I send you a doc with helpful information and advice about rental contracts. If I were you, I'd make sure that the flat is full furnished and you sign a contract with the owner of the flat.Of course, you can stay in my house while you find the accommodation without problem.I hope this information is useful. I look forward to hearing from you soon.Best wishes,---------------------Thanks a lot for your help!!

First of all, I would like to share some of my thoughts.Recently I've read a poem "If" by Rudyard Kipling, before that moment I was familiar only with one of his works - "The Jungle book", which I read in childhood, and I didn't even know that he wrote poems.So, I was very impressed by "If" and now it's one of my favourite poems. I think that words of this poem could be a life motto and highly recommend to read it.

your correction will probably help me find a job, so thanks a lot :pObject: application for an internship - labor lawyer Dear Hiring Manager,Actually in a Labor law Master 2 and holder of a language culture and business of Japan Master 2, I’m allowing myself to send to you this application because working for Nissan would offer the exciting framework of a company at the edge of innovation, a quality reflected in your social relationships. The prospect of learning with you to face the legislation and social challenges of an audacious firm, who bet on human diversity, this is particularly motivating Convinced of the importance of the challenge posed by the labor law between society, I joined a law degree in addition to my first Master course and then chose the law school for my exchange year in Japan. In this experiment, through the encounter of the different actors of the working world, I could see other social practices and I went back convinced  of the need for mutual understanding to manage effective and fair legal management  of working relationships which are now globalized. Determined to put this experience in movement through the practice of social law in a multicultural environment, I completed my education with a master's bringing me the solid knowledge necessary for the lawyer profession. My  unique dual skill combined with my energy, adaptability, writing ability  and rigor of reasoning, qualities manifested throughout my cursus, will, I hope, be helpful for this internship.Our collaboration would last between 4 and 6 months and could start as early as April, in France or elsewhere. Finally, noting that any proposal that allows you to use my double qualification would make our work more productive, I remain at your disposal and would welcome the oportunity to discuss together about this application. Sincerly,

Last week I was horrible busy and went home almost around 10 p.m. everyday, so I have no time to study any German. Anyway as an employee, I have been always trying to solve my working stuffs firstly. And actually I worked hard and I really hope I can get some kinds of promotion. But after 5 years’ hard working, now it seems more and more impossible. Perhaps I have chosen the wrong beginning at first step. In this company, all the leaders are Germans, and all the Chinese are only the side food. I still have not really made this issue clear until this week I had a small divergence with my manager and then he used a kind of dictator‘s way to suppress me. I have already encountered the glass ceiling of my career but I have been so long time not aware of that, until I found that I only can do the routine and boring works day by day. I am not even 29. This is definitely not what I have expected. As like most people, when I graduated from the Uni, I made a plan for my first 5 years. And then I was trying to make 1 year plan. But all the plans like my New Year‘s resolution, none of them have been realized. I have been grown mature and more considerate, but on the other hand, I have not made any achievements in any further study, like my German, because I always have this or that excuse for my absence of study everyday.  I hope it is still not too late for me to make a change. When I was in Uni., I used to like one poem very much. This poem is full of passions and courage. I hope I can always possess this kind of courage, and never be afraid of changing, never quit in frond of difficulties. Below is the poem: The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost 　　Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, 　　And sorry I could not travel both 　　And be one traveler, long I stood 　　And looked down one as far as I could 　　To where it bent in the undergrowth; 　　Then took the other, as just as fair, 　　And having perhaps the better claim, 　　Because it was grassy and wanted wear; 　　Though as for that the passing there 　　Had worn them really about the same, 　　And both that morning equally lay 　　In leaves no step had trodden black. 　　Oh, I kept the first for another day! 　　Yet knowing how way leads on to way, 　　I doubted if I should ever come back. 　　I shall be telling this with a sigh 　　Somewhere ages and ages hence: 　　Two roads diverged in a wood,and I— 　　I took the one less traveled by, 　And that has made all the difference.

Have you heard that singer Lee-Hyo-Lee is called Soon-Sim’s mom? Soon-Sim is a name of an abandoned dog and she is adopted by Lee-Hyo-Lee. As number of people raising pets has increased, number of abandoned pets also increased. According to statistics, the number of people raising pets is almost ten million and the number of abandoned pets is almost hundred thousand a year. Today, I will talk you about the situation of abandoned pets and what should we do for them.   I will start with my personal experience. I have a dog and we have been together for 12 years. When we met first, she is just a little cute puppy. But now she is more than just a pet for me. She is a family member to me. As I raising her, she gives joy to our family and makes us happy. However, raising her also has some hardships. Raising pets requires a great deal of care. Twice a day I should feed her and make her housebroken. Also, raising pets cost too much. Everything for pets normally more expensive than human’s. Especially checking up and some shots for them is really expensive. Therefore although I love her, sometimes raising her is a little burden to me. These are might be the reason that people abandon their pets. That is, expensive registration fees for pets and poor public knowledge of pet care have forced many pet owners to abandon their pets.Now, let me turn to the situation of abandoned pets. In Korea, a hundred thousand pets are being abandoned per year. Some of them are fortunately taken to animal shelter. They stay in there and wait for new owner. However only 20 percent of them are adopted by new owner and the others are euthanized after certain time, about ten days. Also, other abandoned pets would be homeless. There is no food, no safety place for them. In this situation, they might die from hunger or be a road kill.  Then, let’s look at now how should people do for abandoned pets. First, some systems that can connect them with new owner he best solution for them is finding a new owner, so

 Mrs Stappleton said to her husband that he looked much better and invited him to have a drink. He agreed and told her that he knew about the strange visitor they’d had that day. As he couldn’t remember meeting him before, he asked her where she knew him from.Mrs Stappleton explained that they used to have contact with his sister, called Anne Nuttle, and asked him if he remembered her. However, he denied having met her before. Mrs Stappleton exclaimed that he was always forgetting people and suggested that he should pay more attention, but he refused to accept that advice and boasted about having a very good memory. Mrs Stappleton reminded him that the girl used to work in the rectory about four years ago. He said that he was sorry and admitted not remembering her.Finally, Mrs Stappleton told him that the lady’s brother had been there going through a cure for his nerves. She supposed that that was the reason why he acted in such a way; they both thought he really looked disturbed, especially when he ran out of the house. At the end, Mrs Stappleton invited her husband to talk about his day.

Climatic consequences of major nuclear war was the subject of a study,  conducted by United Nations during 1987-1988. According this study, use of nuclear weapons  could affect the climate of areas that are far away from the Ground Zero regions. The conclusion , based on scientific data, is that the major nuclear war will lead to threat of global environmental disruption.  Possible quantitative consequences are the follows: significant reduction of sunlight and heat, that reach the earth’s surface, because of dust, smoke and soot,  presenting in the atmosphere. In some areas,  deviation from the normal weather patterns could be observed, which will result in the appearance of new regions with unusually low temperature or lack of precipitations, which directly affect the rops.			Direct impact of nuclear explosions and global consequences of major nuclear war on the environment will make a process, where each factor would exacerbate the other.   Direct consequence of major nuclear exchange could be death of millions people; its indirect influence may lead to death of billions. Therefore, survivers will face not only destructive  aftermath of the war, but  cold, toxic pollutans, radioactive fall-out, breakdown in food supplies  and lack of (harmless) potable water.  Nuclear exchange could also lead to significant exhaustion of protective ozone layer  in stratosphere, which increase intensity of ultraviolet  radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface.  And this, could make big troubles for injured life form (or living organisms).  The others global effects of major nuclear exchanges for environment could also be determined.

Hello everyone!well to me, Yoga is an experience involving body, mind, emotions and spirit.The Sanskrit word yoga means "to control" or "to unite". A good translation for this word would be “the experience of unity".Yoga first arose more than five thousand years ago in India. It grew from the need to develop an understanding of the various aspects of our experience in this life, from the physical through to the abstract. Throughout history it has proved as an invaluable tool for dealing with the various challenges of human existence.Outside India, the term yoga is typically associated with the so called: Hatha Yoga and its asanas (postures).  Yoga is believed to calm the nervous system and balance our body, mind, and spirit. It is thought by its practitioners to prevent specific diseases  by keeping the energy points open and  Prana (or life energy) flowing. Yoga has been used to lower blood pressure, it reduce stress, and it improves  coordination, flexibility, concentration, sleep, and digestion.  Yoga is usually practised in classes that range from 60 to 90 minutes in length (aprox). In a typical yoga class you'll practise the following principles: •First principle Asana (or body postures) it involves a set of twenty six poses, done at this temperature. This promotes profuse sweating, which is said to help the body rid of toxins. The temperature also promotes flexibility.•Second principle is Pranayama (or breathing control) this helps us achieve a calmer and more focused mind, and increases the energy level.•The third principle is Savasana (corpse/relaxing pose) y releasing tension in the muscles and putting our whole body at rest, you revitalise your nervous system, and if executed well, achieve inner peace making you feel relaxed.•And forth is Dhyana (or meditation) positive thinking and meditation will help remove negative thoughts and put your mind under control.After this... you feel totally refreshed. Ready to start a new day ;) Thanks for reading this! :D

    I'm a Chinese, but it doesn't mean I was born in Beijing. Beijing is the capital of China with long history, and it's in the northeast of China. I came from Guangxi Province in the south part of China. The climate between Beijing and Guangxi is really different. Guangxi is hot in summer and warm in winter. Beijing is also hot in summer but really cold in winter, especially for me, I' m afraid of coldness very much.    I came to Beijing when I was 8, because my mom and dad decided to come to the modern city to find their fortune. Because the winter in Guangxi is warm, so I haven't seen snow before I came to Beijing. I still remember how I feel when I saw the pure snow the first time, so exciting and curous, I touch the cold snow and yelled to my mom surprising. And the next I went to school, my friends threw the snow to me and I threw it back to them happily. How unforgottable the memory was!    I also love the buildings in Beijing. The ancient buildings are classical, the new buildings are modern. The Summer Palace is my favorite place. It's one of the most famous places of interest in Beijing, even in China. There are lakes, hills, the long corridor, the buildings. They are so fantastic! Thousands of paintings was painted on the roof, the pillar, the bridge raillings and so on. I really feel proud of the wistom of our ancesters.    oh that's really a long story, thank you very much to help me corret it.

Dear friends, how many kinds of Chinese food do you know? I would like to introduce several homestyle Chinese foods. The first one is noodles. There are many kinds of noodles in China. Such as: roolled surface noodles, pulled noodles, knife-cut noodles, and fried noodles. Rolled surface noodles are cutted, shaped, or finished by machine. But pulled noodles are made by hand instead of with a machine. If you go to China, there is a hot pot restanrant named Haidilao. It has a special hand thrown noodle presentation for the hot pot. A noodle specialist will come out and literally throw, pull, and drop the noodles infront of you in a mesmerizing dance. The noodles need to be pulled, and the dance just pulls them in a added value style.Knife-cut noodles are made by shaving fresh off a ball of dough with a sharp knife. And fried noodles are just like stir-fried dishes,especially, the main material of this dish are noodles. All of them are delicious. The second one is Dumplings. I bet you must know of them. You must have watched the famous Kung Fu Panda cartoon movie. Those are two typical kinds of chinese food that are shown in this movie: noodles and dumplings. But we also have another dumpling -  boiled dumplings.  We we often eat these during our spring festival.  The third must be chinese stir-fried dishes.Chinese cuisine has a number of different genres, but the most influential and typical known by the public are the 'Eight Cuisines'.The essential factors that establish the form of a genre are complex and include history, cooking features, geography, climate, resources and life styles.Each cuisine has its own features.      I like chinese food very much. Hope you like it too.

So I decided to register myself.In the part of the registration, where they ask you two languages that you're learning. First, I thought in English and French. But a year ago, I started learning Japanese and I thought it was a better idea to write as the languages I was learning French and Japanese. But I'm still learning English, and I think that I still comitting a lot of mistakes XD I'm sure of it. Recently, I discovered that not only I could write texts in French and Japanese, but also in English and any other language. And now I'm writting this text to check-out how my English is doing. What do you think? How bad my text is? Please comment in the bottom ↓↓↓.Another thing that I use to do in order to improve my language, especially my Listening and also my Speaking [while singing songs] is to search songs ♫ in the language I'm studying and its respective lyrics ♪. So I hear the song, while I'm reading and cheking the lyrics and the pronunciation. Also I try to listen to different accents. For example, I try to listen songs of different English accents: British, American, Irish, all are different. Also I use to watch movies in the languages I'm learning, especially in English. But that's more difficult to do in French and in Japanese, because here in my country, there aren't too much movies in French and even less in Japanese. But always I watch most of movies in English. Actually, I prefer in English that in Spanish XD. I know that the best thing you shoud do to improve a language is to speak in that language, but everyone I know, hate languages :'( and they don't wanna talk with me. Well, that all for now, I think I've written enough =D. I'll try to write another text in English. But at leat for now, Do you think there's something else I could do in order to improve my languages? See you later! And thanks for reading my journal! If there's something I could do to help you with your languages...I'll be glad to help you! Good-bye

when this term began,more and more my classmates begin to practise.My major is the management of tourism. Although I got the certificate of guide last year,I don't want to be a guide now.People just know it is highly profitable,but there are some hidden rules thst I can't accept.My roommate and I think the most perfect job is to open our own store which selling goods of anime.while selling ,we can match anime at the same time.I am preparing for another certificate now.After this, I also had to do practice and find a job.I won't be a student any more.So,I will enjoy these left days.

So, I'm sorry. I think I have forgotten to introduce myself just because the question bothers me.Well, my name is Lena, I'm from Russia, 20 years old. Love music, travelling, playing the harp, talking, reading books.I don't think I'm speaking about something really interesting, because I think almost everyone can say the same about himself (despite of the harp may be;)).So I can say I'm awful daughter of my country, not make the profit for it, but as many young people hates Russia, I can say I really love it. This country has sooo many problems in economics, politics, in social life especially, but what county doesn't? Every county has its own problem. Problems are different and problems are not the reason for hating your own country.So why I'm saying I'm not a good daughter of my country. May be because I'm doing nothing at home now, when I should study my C# course (it's the programming language). May be becasue I really hate my future speciality and don't want to be a programmist (I'm the one of that persons who go to university just to get diploma). Russia needs smart young people, who will help it to wake up in the future, but I can't say I'm one of them. I'm just living my life. And I can't say I love the way I live.It's time to change something, but I really don't know what I should change first. Please, don't offer hair cut, I'm trying to let my hair grow:))Well, I think there is no interesting things in my monologue (or there is?:)), so I'll finish.I just want to say my dream is to learn French language. But as I don't see why French is needed for me (may be just to listen french version of Notre Dame de Paris musical without subtitles), it's just a dream. May be I will learn it someday.Bye bye.  Love you all!:)

	Love is a long journey that filled with lessons, hardships, heartaches, joys, celebrations and special moments ,that will lead us to our destinations in life.The road will not always be smooth, In fact, throughout  our travels, we will encounter many challenges.	I wanna show you my own opinion about the love between man and woman. It’s must be the most wonderful thing that you share your shoulders with your loved ones when she or he is in troubles, isn’t it?  I think the true love can over come everything. So once you have, please show your love in evey moment and in all kinds of weather.It's not true that if you are sweet to that person then she will love you more. Maybe she will, maybe she won't. But that is not the point to be good and to be noble. To be good, to be noble is for ourselves because we choose to be that way, we want to keep being that way, and we feel good about it. It's not because, "Okay, now she needs me more. If I show more cares, then our love will be stronger"; So love is to give, It’s not the matter of the aim but the act.

Finally I had reached the safe house.Twenty more steps, the groaning echoes of the undead still ringing in my ears as I remembered everything that had happened in the last 24 hours. Ten more steps, the undead were closing in but I just clenched on to the only thing giving me the strength to continue.My feet felt weak, five more steps, every breath came in shallow and painful, my body groaned in protest, exhaustion was making my vision blurry but I just had to reach that door, that one door that lead to safety and back to my team.I heard glass breaking as windows were shattered. I looked up just in time to see my friends taking positions on the windows of the fourth story house we were using as shelter for the time being. The first volley was shot and took the first row of zombies with them but there were still too many of them. Finally, I reached the door, just as I was about to twist the door knob I felt someone tug at the collar of my shirt, the rooting smell of the undead filled my nostrils as the zombie’s head aligned to my neck and prepared to sink it’s mouth into my flesh, I was too tired to move, too weak to protest I closed my eyes and waited, welcoming death like a long lost friend.The seconds ticked by, and I didn’t feel anything. Am I dead? I found myself asking, just as a warm hand grabbed my hand and helped me stand up. “Get up, dummy!” that voice woke me up from my trance and I opened my eyes.

The young man kept quiet. I would have listened to him until the end of time.-Does it fit you, pretty young girl? Right now, pass me back my glaces; Europa must be awaken. Let's work.He used to pronounce the meanest french word with a meticulous greediness. As a consequence, his story had lasted hours. The afternoon had greatly started.I followed him in the ground floor where he used to live, a one-piece flat which overlooked a courtyard full of oil cans.-What's your job?-Am I wrong or you pronounce in a peculiar way?-I have a little problem with accents, I'll explain you. But, all the same, I repeat: How do you earn a living?-I'am...I'am a sort of policeman.He switched on his computer and cried out:-They've been arriving!!-Who the hell?-The car fines of the week-end: traffic lights gone through, prohibited parkings, bus lanes followed...-I've not seen many traffic lights into town.-It's normal; I'am in charge of the fines from Brest, a city from where you live, in a region called Bretagne I guess.-But why you and why India?-I work three times faster than a Franchman and I cost seven times less.

Personally, I don’t think that increase the teachers’ salaries can improve the quality of education. Actually I don’t think there is a link between the salaries of teachers and the quality of education. A teacher’s salary can never influence the quality of education for the children!First and for most, teachers are the very people who teach students, the future of the world, knowledge. No matter how much money they get every month, they need to try their best to teach the kids good-qualified knowledge they knew. If they teach the students bad-qualified knowledge just because their low level of salaries, they must be recognized as immorality.Second, let’s think such a question that is “Where do the teachers’ salaries come from”. Maybe different countries have its own ways to give teachers money. But we have to know, no matter where the money come from, it is not from the kids, or we can say that the kids can not influence a teacher’s salary even by one dollar! In this case, how can a teacher express his or her anger about the low salaries by giving bad-qualified education to those innocent children?Some schools may give the teacher boundary if the students the teacher teaches get good scores, this kind of reward can improve the teachers’ enthusiasm, and probably that way may improve the quality of education by little. But I still think that teachers must try their best to teach the students and ignored the salaries they would get. Everyone have wishes, and most of us are greedy, especially in money. If you raise a teacher’s salaries, he or she may feel that is not enough instead feel satisfied. In conclusion, I don’t think that raising the salaries of teachers is the best way to improve the quality of education.

This week's General Linguistics and Grammar tests have both been cancelled "for security reasons". Our teachers decided to postpone them because of the chaos created by the strikes; but they don't know the new dates themselves. Same thing for Detective Fiction.Speaking of which, Mme B gave us our Sherlock Holmes paper back yesterday. She suggested that I rewrote mine because it lacked the structure that the French love so much and even if I had a decent grade (12/20), the ideas I mentionned in it were "easely worth a 16". The thing is we don't learn to write papers like that in Belgium. Here, it's all about writing a plan and sticking to it. I don't mind, though. It's awesome that she gives her students a second shot, and it gives me the opportunity to write more effective essays.There's another vote scheduled for Monday. I suspect that they'll decide to continue the 'blocage' for another week (in spite of the finals), and no one knows what will happen then; we're all a bit paranoid at the moment. It turns out that we'll start with Literature or Civilization on the 15th. We never know which one we'll get because they do a random draw, so we have to study for both. So you spend hours on your desk wondering why you bother trying to remember all of those dates because you have a 50% chance NOT to be interrogated on it anyway (that's completely stupid and so evil in my opinion). Thème and Version (French to English and English to French translation) will be on the same day as Phonetics. That's three total. It's alright, because those are classes where you either know the vocabulary or you don't. I'm a bit worried about Phonetics, though... I instinctively know how to do transcriptions, but I have troubles with the secondary stresses and justifying my answers with the rules or the unbelievable number of exceptions. There are just too many of them. D:

HelloI'm French and I speak pretty well English. Although I still have some work on this language, I also want to learn German. That's why I subscribed to Lang-8.Since I'm a complete beginner in German, my posts are going to be pretty simple for a moment, but I'll try and do my best. I'll also post in English, as I want to get a better knowledge of this language and I don't want to lose any of my skills along the way.I'll correct texts in French whenever I got the time, and I hope we can improve all together.Bye !

Dear all,I'm marekba, french guy living in Vietnam. I know i'm still very far from the required level - and that's why i'm here and need your help - , but my goal is in 2 years to attend the CELTA course. The CELTA (acronym for Certificate in English Language Teaching for Adults) requires a level C2 from the European leveling system, or to get positive results from the CPE. Well, i haven't taken any of those tests and my last english class was back when i was at school, so many years ago, but in my current life, i'm used to teach by english.I'm planning to study grammar on my own for the next 2 years, but for the writing style and the spelling, i'd be glad to get some help! Grammatical correction will be welcome as well of course!Looking forward to hearing from you!CheersM.

Learning a foreign language is a hard thing for me,especially English. As I seldom watch American TV programs nor listen to English pop music.(I prefer to rock,but usually I can't clearly make out what the word is.) I like Linkin Park, Evanescence, Within Temptation ,L'arc en ciel, and Rammstein.I also like Enya, Sarah Brightman and Kanafina.I love anime and comic.But recently I haven't found anything interesting. I'm feeling like moving on from anime and comics now. It may be a good thing for me now as I need to pay more attention to my study this year, and also the following one.After 2 years living without English, I found I've almost forgotten it . How to spell the word "foreign"? What is the word "graduate "in English ? Questions is arising one after another.  I'm like a junior learner, a student in primary school. Oh, I think I really need lots of time to improve my English now.

I've been a Brightkite user thesedays.It's a kind of web service like Twitter, but more interesting because it connects Twitter-like short comments and locations and we can search people who are also using Brightkite around us, though I cannot know who he/she really is, and what type of person he/she is.Though we can use it from PCs, we should use it from mobile devices like iPhone, iPod touch, or android.Comparing my iPod touch and android, I realized the importance of multi-task.When I want to know the location of someone, I can touch the map window inside the Brightkite-appli, then a bigger size google map opens.But at this time, iPhone/iPod touch closes the original appli (Brightkite) and opens the Google Map appli, because they are made as single-task.Therefore, when I finish viewing map and want to return to Brightkite, I have to close the Google Map appli pushing the button below and have to restart the Brightkite appli again.On the other hand, android is a multi-task device, so I can open Google Map appli and Brightkite appli at the same time. I don't have to close one appli when I use the other. I can see Maps inside the Brightkite appli.At this point, I think android is better than iPhone, though I know this has both advantage and disadvantage at the same time.Anyway, thanks to the large number of Brightkite users who are checking in from "iPhone", I and many other users can enjoy the great system.

My name is Misael and my article is about pulque, which is a traditional beverage from my country.The Aztecs considered the pulque as the drink of the gods, and it was once very common to find people who sold it.Today it exists in many different flavors such as oatmeal, pineapple or cactus fruit.Although some people often find the consistency of pulque to be daft, I think it is really such a delicious and cool beverageit is relatively cheap and sold in pulcatas (pulcatas is the place where the people sell pulque). Mexico City is very famous for places such as "La risa" or "La hija de los Apaches."Apart from being a beverage, it's also used in many dishes or sauces as a main ingredient.

For me,learning English is a necessity,while learning Japaness is totally out of interest. As it known to almost every Chinese,English plays such an important role in each stage during Chinese people's studenthood as far as the the compulsory education is concerned,the influence of which is too huge to be neglected.English learning is flooded in every corner of Chinese cities,or countryside,.Forgive me if it sounded a lit exaggerating，it's almost true.The English-learning phenomenon is getting too crazy that a team of the vanguard Chinese educators had to stand out calling for law legislators to put more emphasis on the traditinal Chinese learning.However one thing that you should be informed of the Chinese education,the chance of being enrolled in a top university would be slim to none if that person failed in the English test during the Entrance Examination to College.I have seen lots of the aboved-mentioned example around me.The situation is changing slightingly, though I don't see it make any difference.Funnily enough,on one point the so-called influential people holding the progressive banner would call for the stop of the over-expanded craziness on learning English,on the other hand they keep evaluating  students' abilities based on their scores of the English tests.As for Japaness Learning,there is no pressure coming around.Since I have no intention in taking any sort of test,I learn it in my most pleasant way,whether it's a good way or bad one,it's my way.I was nitpicked more than once for my Japaness-writing and pronuciation esp. those on Hitagana which I suck at very much.I guess it has lots of things to do with the fact that a large quantity of Japaness words written in Hitagama are directly changed from English pronuciation.As stubborn as I am, to forsake the original English pronuciation for the sort of strangely unfamiliar one is the last thing I will force myself to do.My point is as long as I can carry on a proper conversation with the those who speak Japaness,the result doesn't seem that important as the process,does it?Surely different people will have a different take.Frankly speaking,I am a lit bit envious of the native English speakers.Instead of having to start out a new session of language learning,you guys were born to embrace the ability of speaking this internationally-acknowledged language.But I guess it's a double-edge sword if we really puts our feet into the situation.The fact is to be able to speak in English may have let you guys lose lots of chances to be getting closer to a differnt fascinating culture now that people coming from various nationalities choose to pick up English as their second language,or I might be in the wrong side.Anyway,my envious part definately takes the upper edge.Will Chinese become the internationally-speaking Language one day?Could be though.The point is regardless how eagerly I wish for it to happen so that it could alleviate some burdens on the Chinese students, at this moment only does it exist in my sweet dreams...

these days, I realize seriously how necessary the money is in my life.Since it's quite difficult to keep the balance between studying and working idealy, I've focused on first thing. but shortly after this, I realized that working was also important. without this, I can't manage my daily life. I can't take a bus to school, I can't even have the cheapest lunch in school restaurant. I can't check the text messages and answer the phone as i failed to pay for my cellphone fee.Luckily, I started to work as part-time worker at a bakery which guarantees good payment compared to the work hours.but the case is how to survive until the day of monthly payment. no other choice, I lended money from some of my friends as much as i can keep living until monthly payment.I really can't wait. I owe to many friends of mine and i really want to return the favor by treating them to some delicious cuisine or something.

In my opinion, understanding of the language is necessary to communicate with others and this is the first step to understanding one’s culture. On top of this, by improving my ability to read in Japanese, I will be able to learn from books about history, art,  and everything that is part of the Japanese civilization.""Studying history is something fascinating for me. It enables you to understand nowadays civilization and traditions, and how the arts, literature, technology evolved until now through the social context for different periods of time. Japanese history is a very interesting and vast subject I want to study in Japan.""Literature is something really important to me. Japan has great authors and philosophers and studying literature is a good way to understand the present social context of one's culture, to understand how to express thoughts and feelings, and to improve reading ability and vocabulary."Thanks.

Hi everyone, this is my first entry, and I will talk about why do I learn English.I took my first English classes when I was 6 years old. My mother has enrolled me in a out of school activity like she did with my big brother. I don't remember a lot of things about these classes, except about my school teacher "Suzy" and that I really enjoyed to take these courses.After that, I took English classes at school like all of child but I never lost my passion for this language. When I was 14 (approximativly), I watched one of my first serial in english, it was "Charmed", this american serial with 3 witches. Do you remember about it? Since that date, I can't stand to watch a serial except than its original version.From now on, I want to improve my english because I need it in my future job, I work in computer programming and a lot of thing is in english. But I also want to make an international career that's why I need to improve my english because I make a lot of conjugation and grammar mistakes. I will stop there I think you got my main reasons about writing here.See you soon all and thank you for reading

I thought the tennis court was going to close, and I couldn't do a tennise exercise. At the time I remembered she had told us it is a good weather or it stops rain whenever she doessomething outside. I said to myself no way.In fact, it had stopped raining before our lesson. It was still cloudy, butwe could do it. Today she had another plan , so she had to go home inthe middle of  the lesson. She left the tennis court. Few minute later,suddenly it started to rain and we had to stop it.I'm sure her story is real.

I am a viola player.(Viola is larger than violin, you know.)So I always practice playing the viola to be a good player and to be a member of my orchestra.While I play, I think how should I do for making the sound better.I try to struggle to explain how my right arm moves to skratch stringss in words, because understanding how it moves now is need to think about what will I change my function of it in the future.However it is difficult for me to translate my sense of my arm into words, ofcoarse it is more into English.I need both a good teacher of viola and a good of English!

Hello:)This is the first time I write something here.I'm studying English with my best friend 2 times a week.We translate korean into english with the article but we can't sure our writing is right or not.so.. please help us!!↓This is the article we translated today.It is from the Stone Age that women prefer tall men to short men because tall person was profitable to hunting. The most important standard of choosing the sex partner to women was the ability of supporting in the old age. It is reasonable that the tall hunter was the best prospective bridegroom because he could support his family abundantly.

Yestarday I saw very funny film about Bushmen. It is a South African tribe who lives in desert Kalahari. Firstly I have heard about them from guy from South Africa who now lives in Ukraine. So, he has told me a lot of interesting facts about Bushmen and I has been really interested to watch movie about them.Yestarday evening film was successfully downloaded and I got really pleasent watching this old movie. I starded loving Bushmen even more - they are so smile, so naive. Plot of the film is simple and not very intriguing but hilarious. It is about one Bushmen who go to "the end of the Earth" in order to get rid of bad thinkg (bottle of coca-cola) that has made trobles in his tribe. There are also one funny personage - scientist who afraid of speaking with woman.I can recommend "God must be crazy" for everebody who likes hoax, nature and old movies.

I have one dream, maybe it is not the only one but it is the main one anyway. Do an around the world without time limit, by foot or by bicycle. I will not be totally satisfied until I realize this dream. I just want to meet other people, to discover other cultures, other lifestyles, other landscapes. Not to be stressed by work, by family, by society. Sort of freedom actually. I know that a lot of people do not share my view because they are either too lazy, or not too courageous, or because they simply have not the same dreams.Generally, people are afraid of what they do not know. I do not. I am afraid of the routine, the "métro-boulot-dodo" like we say in french ("subway-work-sleep"). I cannot imagine me spending my entire life in only one place, here in my little village, southern France.I want to travel. That is the only reason why I have started engineering studies, because we can spend one year abroad during the fourth year, and we can do training session abroad too.I wait...

Hi! Thanks for reading this small introduction.My name is Santiago Madrigal. I live in Bogotá (Colombia) and found out about Lang-8 in a post at tofugu.com, which is a blog about Japanese culture and learning the Japanese language. When I saw the video review of this site on that blog, I... I just found the whole concept really cool!! You write about whatever you want in your target language, and other people correct it for you. Also, you help other people with their target language by correcting their mistakes and giving advice. An almost perfect give-receive language system!!SO, given that I REALLY want (and need!) to polish up my English writing skills before tackling my Japanese with more dedication, I decided to stop thinking about mayyyybe joining somedayyyyy, and actually joined yesterday at night. So... here I am. Ready to write about the most random stuff I can come up with, willing to receive help from you people, and also very very willing to help all of you that are currently learning Spanish.So... yeah... be MERCILESS with your corrections!!! >:D

The other day some relatives came to visit us, one day after breakfast  my parents and i went to pick them up at the hotel they were staying and then we went to a lake near the city, it's about 2 hours from the city,  we stayed a while, and after a ride  on boat we went to  eat in a restaurant in a town near the city, it took us about 3 hours to get there because of the traffic and some rapairs of the highway, but it worthed it,  we  ate something called “Birria”, it's basically  meat of sheep in soup but it's very good though. After that we return at the hotel's lobby to rest a moment, so when it was about 8 o'clock we went to a very famous bar in the city called “El Parian”,we drank some beer and talked, and around midnight we  decided to leave, and went to the hotel again but this time just to let them there and say goodbye to my cousins and uncles and we came home after that. It was a very long day, but it was also kinda fun.

In this figure we can see the proportions of employed students four month after they left their universities from 1995 to 2001. As can it be seen the number of men and women that found full time job rose gradually. Over the period more men employed than women.From year to year number of employed men stays more than women? especially in 200 year, when percentage of employed men reached just over 84%. However, the number of men and women is equal in 2001 year.From the chart it can be concluded steady grows of similar rate of male and female ex-students that got a job in four month time, but we can notice there is slight fall in 2001 year.

Hi everybody, I'm going to speak about dreams.By "Dreams", i don't want to say, big dreams, for example the dreams which we made when we were young, become astronaut is a current dream for childrens for example. Well, no, i prefer to call it "Objectives or goals", I think than nobody can have a good and happy life without objectives, personnally, the thing who make me very happy, it's when I've a hard goal to achieve and with work, determination and courage, I arrive to do my objective. I think, a man who hasn't got goals in the life will have a sad and ordinary life, but I don't want to do generalities.  So, for me we cannot be perfect, so there are always goals in the life, there is always something to improve. It's an important part of happiness, for example, if we take the case of an obese man, it's really a disability in life. So, this man must have the goal to do a diet and sport but he must also conjugate this objective with others goals as "succeed at work" or "make a happy family". The combination of this objectives while he achieve his main goal (Slim) make him very happy.Personnaly, I have actually some goals, like achieve my studies, do sport to make me a beautiful body.. All this goals are conjugate around my main objective, more later I would like to go to others countries. Goodbye :)

The given two graphs illustrate the percentage of each source of energy used in America during the period of the 1980s and the 1990s. The sources are oil, natural gas, coal, hydroelectric power and nuclear power.As it can be observed from the first graph, in the 1980s, the source of energy used the most in the USA was oil, with 42 percent. Natural gas and coal accounted for 26%, 22% respectively. Compared to other sources, hydroelectric power and nuclear power were not used a lot.Turing to the next graph, there are some changes for 20 years. First of all, the percentage of oil as the source of energy decreased from 42% to 33%, on the other hand, coal’s percentage went up to 27% by 5%. In the case of nuclear power which was used a little bit in the 1980s, there is a twofold increase. There is almost no change on the percentage of natural gas.I'm preparing IELTS and I have difficulty taking IELTS test, especially writing. Thank you for helping me :)

In my opinion, diploma is more important for new graduates who are busy looking for jobs. Cause employers know those students  almost have nothing to do with work experience except diplomas. what the emplyers care about is the youth, energy and potential of them.But for those elder job-hoppers, work experience is more important than diplomas. Employers care more about their work experience instead of their diplomas. Work experience is the most powerful competence for them.please help me correct it, thanks a million in advance.

These days I was thinking about what I've done during the last 4 months since I came to Sydney.What confused me is that although I live in here but can't make any local Australian friend=( Every day I just got a few chance to speak English cos all my classmates and friends are Chinese.And today is the first time I feel like my life sucks under the Southern Cross Star that I thought I'm a loser within a huge waste of money and the feedback is a tiny improvement.Although the result of my mid-semester exam is not too bad but I know the good GPA is owe to my A+ Maths that on the opposite side ,my Academic english is only C+.I hate my Academic English teacher,yes, both of them that one of them is a sham gay(I support gay rights but I hate people acting like an absolutely gay says "I hate gay ,they are disgusting" using a sissy tone) and another is a French woman who always talk about sex! Thanks to them for make me fed up with Academic english!!!!!!!On the way back home when I finish the whole day study,I thought about my parents whom working damn hard for support me studing in Australia, I can't help myself stop crying.They are 50 years old already but still working 10 hours a day just for their disappointing daughter whom is a stupit burden....Pressures  make me can't breath maybe flee away is the best choice.

Hi everyone,this is my first post here. I hope I'll be updating my page quite often.I moved to Australia about a year ago, but my English still needs improvement. I don't have much oral or written communication, though I try to read books in English and watch movies without subtitles.Australia is a great country to live, but the only minus is that it is too far away from all other world :) I haven't seen my parents since I left, but Skype really helps to keep in touch with my close friends and family. Now it's almost midnight here, so I'd better to go to bed. I decided to take up jogging in the morning again, so I'll have to get up early tomorrow.Thanks in advance for your help, guys!

I know little about soccer.So this June is not a special month for me.But my husband insisted on my watching the World Cup on TV with him.After he took almost 10 minutes to explain the word "offside" ,he gave up the idea that soccer can be taught to his wife.In fact when I watch the games,I can also get fun.I enjoy the exciting moment when the ball is getting closer to the goal.And thanks to the high speed cameras,I laugh a lot.They capture too many funny faces and funny moves.But there is also something disappointed me. I always thought soccer field with clean green grass was so beautiful.But I was wrong.Players spit to it.In the game,they spit saliva.When the game is over,they gargle and spit the water.Even a player spat out a chewing gum.I saw him chewing it during his game.Isn't it a dangerous thing?And I must say something about the noisy horns in stadium.In TV stream,they turn to a sound like millions of flies flying around my ears.That almost kills me.

Hey,everyone.i have a question which really bothers me lately.could anyone tell me what does the sentence "where are you up to"mean.because someone said it means like where're you going and some people said:  "I suggest that 'Where are you up to?' means: How far have you got? You could ask this when you want to know how far someone has got in reading a book, following a series of exams and so on. If you want to know what someone is doing at the moment, you could ask: What are you up to these days?"i don't know which is the correct anwser.sincerely looking forward for your help.

One of my friend recommended a site named lang-8. Users writes diary in foreign languages then native speakers will fix it for the writer. That's the power of community.The cost of doing tasks by people isn't evenly distributed. I mean tasks that are difficult for some people may be easy for other people. As trading goods improves overall productivity, I think these kinds of communities can also improve overall happiness. So this is what people say "collective intelligence", isn't it?Wikipedia is a good example. People's knowledge isn't evenly distributed. Most of the time, I get help by reading articles, but I still have opportunity to write/modify articles about material that I'm good at.Well.. Will there be any sites that will cover other areas?

        After graduating from a high school, many people want to enter a college school to continue study. There are many advantages for the students to enter a college.	First, in college we can specialize. Before entering a college, we have little opportunity to specialize a subject. For example, when we in the high school, we must focus on the primary subjects, these subjects are very important but everyone learns the same, everyone has no difference. But we may have different interests, so when we entered the college, we can choose what subject we want to learn, and we can focus on it. This gives us a chance to deeply research the subject.	Second, college life can let us stand on ourself’s own. College life is much different from the high school, we will leave with the parents even we may go aboard. In this reason, we must learn how to take care of ourselves. If we mastered this skill, it will be helpful in the future life. Also, we can meet many new friends in the college, especially the roommate. We will have more enjoyable time but also we may have to face the association problems in the daily life. To learn how to deal with people’s relationship is also a very important skill for us.	Finally, we may have more chance to get a better job, higher salaries by having a college diploma. Access to a diploma can make us more competent when we search jobs. Famous college’s diploma has more value. For examples, once we get a B.S. in economics, we can have a job in the financial companies, most of these companies have a higher payment for their stuff then other companies, also we can find in the government financial department. Have a financial diploma is necessary to get these jobs.  Employers want to employ those who have high-competence, for these people have more opportunity to create greater profit for them, and also the employers will pay more to these high-competence college students. So, a diploma will become an important thing in our career.	So, to get more knowledge, to face more friends, to practice our personal ability, to get more chance to have a better job, we need to attend college.

hello~ nice to meet you all of you!Can I ask you something here?Well, these days i'm taking the religion class which teach about the bible in english. and we're going to discuss about some below questions.So, does anyone give me the model answers?First, the text which we're going to discuss is the part of the bible like this...Luke 1:46-80, 2:1-20(I'm so sorry it's too long.)Mary's Song  46And Mary said:    "My soul glorifies the Lord     47and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,  48for he has been mindful       of the humble state of his servant.    From now on all generations will call me blessed,     49for the Mighty One has done great things for me—       holy is his name.  50His mercy extends to those who fear him,       from generation to generation.  51He has performed mighty deeds with his arm;       he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.  52He has brought down rulers from their thrones       but has lifted up the humble.  53He has filled the hungry with good things       but has sent the rich away empty.  54He has helped his servant Israel,       remembering to be merciful  55to Abraham and his descendants forever,       even as he said to our fathers."  56Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home. The Birth of John the Baptist  57When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son. 58Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.  59On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah, 60but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John."  61They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."  62Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child. 63He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John." 64Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak, praising God. 65The neighbors were all filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things. 66Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him. Zechariah's Song  67His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:  68"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,       because he has come and has redeemed his people.  69He has raised up a horn[d] of salvation for us       in the house of his servant David  70(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),  71salvation from our enemies       and from the hand of all who hate us—  72to show mercy to our fathers       and to remember his holy covenant,  73the oath he swore to our father Abraham:  74to rescue us from the hand of our enemies,       and to enable us to serve him without fear  75in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.  76And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;       for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,  77to give his people the knowledge of salvation       through the forgiveness of their sins,  78because of the tender mercy of our God,       by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven  79to shine on those living in darkness       and in the shadow of death,    to guide our feet into the path of peace."  80And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the desert until he appeared publicly to Israel.Luke 2The Birth of Jesus  1In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. 2(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) 3And everyone went to his own town to register.  4So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. 5He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. 6While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, 7and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. The Shepherds and the Angels  8And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. 9An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 10But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. 11Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ[a] the Lord. 12This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."  13Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,  14"Glory to God in the highest,       and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests."  15When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."  16So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. 17When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 18and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 19But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 20The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told. and finally these are the discussion questions...1. review Mary's song, what does her words say about her?2. Zachariah said in verse 69 that 'God was sending salvation from the enemies and those who hated them; did he have a clear understanding of John and Jesus' mission?3. Luke 1:66 says that the Lord was with John. Does that mean that John would be successful, healthy, smart etc.? explain.4. In your opinion, what is success?5. Is it possible to be successful and not be rich or powerful? explain.I'm sure I'm just not going to copy your model answers. I'm just..I'm not good at english. So please help me...ㅜㅜAnyway have a nice day and thank you~~

Of course I'm not saying I'm a native speaker, I'm far far away from that. I'm afraid my mother tongue which is Spanish influences my English a lot. I've found myself several times trying to say something the way I'd do it in Spanish, and as those languages are quite similar each other sometimes I trust too much in that deed trying to say a word I don't know in English using my Spanish vocab with a weird accent because maybe the word is similar in both languages, which sometimes works but most of the times it doesn't. Anyway, I believe that this site will help to train my brain to think the way a native English speaker would think. I've found myself really enjoying learning new languages because I believe languages are not only words or grammatical structures but a way to deliver your mind to people you wouldn't even imagine, and I came to realised that languages contain the culture and I'd go farther and say the heart, the passion and manners of the people. I'd like to encourage the people out there to learn a second and why not a third tongue as it is a great experience.

Greetings from Russia!My name is Lena and I’m from Moscow. Now I would like to write some sentences about jigsaw puzzles;)The fact is I have a hobby. My hobby is gathering jigsaw puzzles. I prefer those which consist of one thousand pieces or more. Also I choose only the pictures where some fantasy topics or beautiful nature and city views are depicted. Recently I have finished doing another one. So a few days ago I went to the hobby shop to buy a new one. It is situated in a mall in the suburbs of Moscow. There were a lot of people there as it was a day off. Also there was a wide choice of pictures there. That’s why my choice wasn’t very easy. I had been roaming for about 2 hours before I bought the picture I liked best of all. This jigsaw puzzle depicts one of beautiful views of London, which I was lucky to visit some weeks ago. Having bought it I dropped in at some other shops located in the mall. Before leaving it I looked in at the supermarket to buy some groceries.

Hey sorry to write something so long, but I really need a brief correction before sending it, I will really apreciate your help!!!The Role of the Youth for Achiveing the Cairo Agenda:	Egypt has proposed a model to be followed by other nations, specially those who are also part of the developing countries and  have similar goals to reach, like control of their economical growth, life standars improvement, respect for the human rights and a better education and health levels. As the youths from around the world get to know better the propositions made by the Cairo Agenda we will be able to better apply them in our own comunities affecting with this the development of international comunities aswell.	Depending on our own original countries, cities and circumstances we have new perspectives of analysis determined by the different times, geographic places and ideologies under which we have been educated, and therefore complement the proposals already formulated by the Cairo Agenda, we, the new generations live with a different disposition before the problems from the world. And depending on our own different abilities we can contribute to reach the objectives and be part of the solution to these problematics.	Our places of origin are different, and present different problems that  are treated with different Solutions. It is necessary to spread internationally this problematics, exposing the situation of each of our own countries and to act like agents of change, learning about new solutions from different points of view to reach the proposed goals.  	Nevertheless, the world undergoes a continuous and inevitable process of globalization, and each time more and more, the human kind, functions like a unique global community at world-wide level, and, no matter the geografic distances we depend on each other to construct a society that respects the values and necessary principles to secure an existence with better life quality, and to assure a future where the differences and individualities are included, supported and respected.	In just a short time we will be the responsible to provide  solutions to the health conflicts, population growth and poor life quality and dignity , for that reason it is important to adapt us to the new exigencies of International crisis; In the youth lays the responsability and capability of  interchanging and spreading the information to come up with the solutions for an optimal population grow as well as dissease prevention, since youth is a segment of the population strongly affected by sexually transmitted diseases. 	We are the direct link to the next generations of children, who require to be educated from as early as possible under the values of respect, gender equality, non-violence, cooperation and measures of hygiene among others.	We can also be a connection between privileged citizens and those  who do not count with the necessary means to solve these problems, or are not aware of the solutions that the global societies are carrying out to face and to contribute to develop life qualities, we are a key link between the problematic premises and the resources to solve them.

Internet has changed our lives in many different ways, one of them is shopping. Online shopping has become very popular in recent years. Nowadays it’s highly developed in some sectors like transport, hotels etc. But it’s still used by a minority in many other sectors like clothing, food etc.The greatest benefit of online shopping is that it allows us to buy things very quickly and without the need to move to the shop. So online shopping saves us a time and money.Another point in favour of this technology is that it facilitates the trade, because it allows us to buy things very far away produced.In addition online shopping has promoted the exchange of products between private people through websites like Ebay.One downside is that nowadays people who did no have access to Internet connexion have many difficulties to buy some things on their own.Another drawback is the lose of work positions and the impersonality, because the client never meet the seller and this could increase the number of swindles.On the whole online shopping is a great invention, the benefits are more much important than the drawbacks and I think that in the future we are going to buy almost every thing using online shopping.

Sometimes we hear: "This is unique person!" or "I never met man(woman) like you!" or "He is so ordinary" But if we will think about this from another point of view...I reached the following conclusions.Firstly, I think that there is no ordinary people. Because every person is unique. There is no person like this in the world! And you can gain expirience from communication with every individual you met. Will this expirience be good or bad for you... depends from YOU. But not from this person.Secondarly, there is no... unique people. If someone very important leave you then formed emptiness which must be filled with surroundings. World will form for you necessary combination to keep your life go on :) So meny people who told "I never can live without you" live without and feel very happy.

Hello, I'm from Russia. I learn English, Spanish and French. I'd like to learn Arabian, Chechen language, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Portugal and, may be, some oriental languages, but everything is good in its season.I have learned English 9 years at school, 4 years in the University and now 3 months by myself (or: 1.independantly. 2.on self-instruction). I can read in English, also I can understand speach on TV and in the films (movies), but I still couldn't write correctly and could not speak fluently. So, I suppose, this site will help me to learn the language.I live in the city, and I have 2 pets at home: a cat Faina 7 months old and a dog Gray 11 years old. You can see my kitty on the photo. It is very smart and lively. I named my cat in honour of Faina Ranevskaya, the popular actress both in the Soviet Union and Russia. And I named dog in honour of the hero of the story "Scarlet sail" or "Scarlet canvas" by Alexander Grin.Two times a week I go to the open swimming-pool. It is very fun to sweam when it snows. Now it is about -28 degrees C outdoors, but temperature of water in the sweaming-pool is +31. In summer I like to travel, mostly at the sea and towards steppes. I like warm and hot weather, but in my city there are not so many days like this. That is why in winter I go to sweam.

The sun was slowly bidding farewell to the valley of Argaan, a paradise in the skirts of the Asmadaar Mountain(1) range which was dotted with trees as well as thickets and blanketed with green grazing land much to the contentment of herbivorous mammals along with their predators.	A orange sky, clear of clouds, opened expansively until vanishing behind the peaks of the mountain range whose crests were shrouded with everlasting snow and whose foothills were carpeted with a dense forest, which made them almost impenetrable. In the heart of this valley subsisted Liinde'si, the southern outpost of the Jotari realm. No rightly a town, no even a village, just two buildings and three or four tents around a well, which granted shelter for a garrison of eight warriors and their families, as well as some few furs traders. Total population: 37. However, considering that Liinde'si was the only post in the area, there was a lot of transit of hunters, trappers and fur traders coming in and out.	“Hey Katain, can you please help me reaching the tree by the well so I can climb up?” Asked the young Asmaan to the warrior. Asmaan was a restless kid who has become the terror of the post, always getting in trouble by his out of control curiosity.	“And what business has a little kid with a tree he can't even climb by himself?” Teased Katain the troublesome pest.	“I want to have a better look at the sunset.” The kid responded quickly.	“And picking some fruits in the process, I guess.” Laughed Katain at the quick response.	“Well, what if I get some for you?” 	“Ok, we got a deal. Hope your mother don't get on me for doing this.” Katain lifted the lad and walking toward the lofty tree, assisted him in getting a lower branch. Seconds later the kid was lost in the abundant foliage and Katain went back to his post. The sun was already gone and the first shadows of the night visited the surroundings when Katain decided to check on the boy. When getting close to the well Katain spotted five strangers around the pond, pulling water out of the well. For the nature of the post it was not infrequent to see strangers at any given time. Or at least that was what Katain thought at seen those five characters. 	“Be welcome to our hospitality!” He saluted while nearing the strangers. That would be his last greeting. The five strangers turned around and at sighting Katain they just vanished in thin air. Katain had barely time to realize that those were not ordinary people but some eerie creatures, before his throat was slit from behind.	Asmaan's mother, who has been looking for the kid, witnessed the slaying and shrieked frightened. In seconds the entire garrison was around the well, weapons in hands, just in time to see how a creature stabbed her in her back. They charged outraged but didn't stand a chance against the heinous creatures, who only could be seen when it was too late. The manslaughter lasted five minutes and after that Liinde'si population dropped to one. That one being Asmaan who, from the tree, watched the whole massacre.

The meaning of the singing from migratory birds.I often hear Chinese geese singing in the sky in the early morning. Today I heard them singing again while they were flying to the habitat for winter season. They must have flown through the whole night. How tired they are. The singing seems to come from the long journey. Their singing cheer themselves each other. Maybe they are talking about their destination from the night flight. Where is the destination? The leader or elders would answer like this, Not far, it's so near. I thought to myself like this.This is my first diary to learn English composition.

Hello folks,First of all, nice to meet you. I am Smiley Cheryl from Southern China. By chance I settled down here. Lang-8 still is a mysterious place for me to explore. Maybe under your guidance I can get familar with this place soon. By the way, I am an English learner and I am crazy about learning this language. The pity is that I just learn by self. So the unavoidable errors seems here and there. Especially the grammatical mistakes annoy me so much. Hey, how do you like learning English Language? And would you like to share your precious experiences with me? I am in the full conviction that your experience and wisdom can be my treasure. You know sharing and receiving is kind of happiness. It's a good way to be happier by sharing thoughts with others, don't you think so? Learning a language is a permanent project. How many people can master a language flawlessly? It's hard! Are you going to be a language specialist? Or a linguist? I am sure that's not your purpose. Maybe you intent to learn this language for getting a better life. Nevertheless, its better to keep at it!~Please give me your hand with my limited English. Thanks in advance.Let's help one another.

Some of us think that it is better to see the films than to read the books in the original. Because students can save plenty of time learning about the story by watching films. It is really a kind of concentrate that can improve our efficiency on study. Also, there are a lot of interesting characters and fantastic scenes in the movies. And it will be easy for us to understand the story.On the other hand, there are quite a few advantages in reading books in the original, too. We can get more details in the book and can appreciate the emotional expressions from the author more deeply. In addition, the vivid descriptions in the books are pretty attractive to readers.Personally speaking, both the film and the book in the original are good for our cultivation. They are able to help us broaden our horizons. And we can obtain a lot of knowledge from them!

A public debate on should government spend more money on improving highways or public transportation has arisen to attention. There are diverse attitudes from people with distinguishing backgrounds. Some people like ones living in villages argue that government should spend more money on improving highway; while, to some extent, some city folks prefer investing in public transportation. Personally speaking, I recommend that government should spend more money on improving highway. There are several conspicuous aspects as follows.The main reason for my propensity is that highway is playing a vital role in the development of the villages, since highway could closely connect rural and urban. Firstly, living in a noisy place for a long time, city people more would like to spend their holidays in villages where is quiet, close to the nature, and with less pressure which is health for them. Thus, it would boost rural travel industry. Moreover, higher and higher house price in cities have forced a lot of people, especially young people, to take a heavy burden. With highways, it is much easier for them to drive between cities and villages daily, so they can choose a relatively cheaper house in villages near the cities. Thus, many companies, such as super markets, will be introduced to villages and prompt the development of the villages.Another reason for my propensity is that highway is an infrastructure which building highways will provide relatively many jobs for some people who are the unemployed. Take building a highway as example, government building a highway, which is a huge project. It needs more many people to work and it is one of solutions to question that help the unemployment. It provides guarantee the unemployed a basic living level, highway is free to people as well. Moreover, an enterprise is not able to building a highway for it has not enough money to support it. Even if it has ability to build it, the aim of the enterprise is attain more many profits from it. Such as: the establishment of toll gate is a common phenomenon. This is a very huge expense that individual driving one’s own car to work will spend around 50 yuan from villages to cities which have 40 kilometer daily. However, government builds highways to serve the people by the people to pay taxes. All in all, some people may still remain unconvinced, the reasons I have analyzed could at least make them more aware of the various dimensions of the issue under discussion. There is little doubt that more and more people will come to realize that government should spend more money on improving highway. Not only provide so many job to people who is the unemployed, but also provides a convenient and fast service to people who are living in the villages and work in the cities.

dear brother,I write you this letter to talk about my life at Lyon. We hadn't seen since the last holiday I'm sorry to write not before but every day I have to work a lot to succes at the university. However, I arrive to spend time to do other things, for example the last week-end, i went to a friend's birthday party. By the time it started, I had helpt her to buy the alcohol because she was not 18 years old. And we stayed at the party until it finished because I had to help her to range her apartment, but the day after I was a little tired because I have drunk more that I would have drunk  ( don't say that to mum because she will be shocked). But whereas, I know to spend a good time, I have to work. The next week I will have to do a math's homework, it's a few difficult, however, as soon as I finish it, I will watch an other movies of Tim Burton. I would watch alice an the wonderland but I had no time.I have to work, I say you goodby, and I expect to see you soon

There is serious occasion to pay attention of the public to question of lessons of computer literacy for first-graders. At many schools acquaintance to information technology begins already in elementary school. This innovation has called storm of discussions as not all experts look at this question equally. Certainly, positive sides of this project are indisputable. Namely, nobody doubts that any schoolboy is obliged to be able to work with the computer, receiving the certificate about education. Information technologies supersede out-of-date things.However, there is underside of project. Numerous researches of last years show that about 25-30 % of children, coming to the first classes, have those or other deviations in state of health; among graduates school already more than 80 % it is impossible to name absolutely healthy.Experts-physicians notice the disturbing tendency of deterioration of physical health of children all at earlier age. Here affect both inactive way of life, and lack of games in the open air, and long sitting behind desk or the computer. Besides, necessity to consider small objects at a short distance from eye negatively influences sight of the child.Furthermore, there are also psychological problems. If it is a question of the child, the serious control from outside parents behind the maintenance of games and orientation of sites which the child visits on the Internet is necessary. It is necessary to protect completely the child from malicious and severe games. But even if game or the program is focused on age of the kid, it is impossible to start simply it on the computer and to leave the child from it alone. Even the best computer games and programs do life one-sided, and development defective.

In this day and age, modern technology like computer has fundamentally changed people’s life. People use computers to search information and deal with massive work. Besides, computer is changing people’s life style. An increasing number of people start to work at home using computer. However, I can’t say it is completely true that working at home using computer or telephones is better than working in the office. First, computers contain office software as well as recreational functions. If one is not self-disciplined, it is easy for them to lose track of time when they use the internet at home. Take my friend Emily as an example, she is a columnist. Once she worked at a newspaper office. Chatting on line, watching movies or browsing irrelevant websites are not allowed during work time, so she has to just focus on her work. But this year she started to work at home. She writes articles at home and sends them to editors by e-mails. I thought this would be great as she doesn’t need to spend time on commute. However, she told me that at home she can’t help logging on msn and chatting with people or browsing irrelevant websites, sometimes she even plays computer games. As a result, she gradually became a procrastinator. These days she often starts to finish her tasks near deadlines. Second, working at home makes people isolated. Working in the office provides an opportunity to get along with colleagues. And sometimes colleagues can be good friends, which brings lots fun. In contrast, working at home will damage people’s health physically and mentally as they move less and mostly stay alone. Working at home seems more convenient yet makes people distant from each other. I have to admit that modern technology like computer and telephone do bring convenience to people’s life. They enable people to work at home and make schedules more freely. However, I still believe that the defects of working at home outweigh its merits since there is no guarantee that working at home enhance proficiency yet does exert detrimental influence upon physical and psychological soundness of people.

I think the most important day in my life was day, when I finished the university and got the diploma. That day I become a computer programmer. I remember that day very good, and I remember my feelings in that day. It was incredible for me. I realized, that I studied very long time, almost all of my life at that moment. And now I am ready to choose my future, choose the way in my life.  That day I said to myself, "from now I'm completely grow up and I have to start live very serious life and do only serious things".  And till now I think that it was a very important moment in my life.

I had a dual sitiznship both Japanese and Indian until 22-year-old. When I had to make a dicision which nationality I should take, I was thinking  that which shitizinship would take more advantage of me to live in this world. The answer was a Japanese one for me at that time.When I was a college student, the oppotunity to go studyabroad to Canada came to me.I homestayed Nanaimo, BC, Canada, for 3 months and had a so nice expierience. I could make  a lot of friends who were from a variety of cuntries such as chinese, korean,cuban and Canadian which was so exciting for me to communicate with them.I miss them so much.thanks very much for reading my bad English dairy.See ya soonReona

In 2 months, I'll be back home. Not for long, because I'm heading to Ireland a few weeks after.At some points I got sort of sick of China, everything was annoying me, the people, the behavior, the language, the food... It was a kind of sign that I needed to go home. Now I'm good again, I like China, people are nice, etc. :DA strange thing happened to me too, I usually hate French songs. I really do, but being away from home made me wanna listen to it.I was in the subway the other day, listening to Jacques Brel (Ok, ok, I'm not really up-to-date, he's an old singer) and I really became homesick.I was listening to "Le plat pays" (The flat land). It's a song describing my country, Belgium. My whole life, I only thought about running away from Belgium, discovering the world, living in exciting places and all but still. At that point, I wanted to jump in a plane and be at home, with my grey sky, my green garden, the little spring we have in the back of the garden, the ponds, the flowers.etc.I know that once there, I'll only think of getting out again though !I've also been nostalgic thanks to "The road to home" from Amy McDonalds, you should listen to those 2 !Anyway, "Le plat pays" is, I think, the best description of Belgium ever, so I wanted to share it with others ! It's a poem in French, quite hard to understand actually (even for French-speakers I mean, like me !), he plays with words.Avec la mer du Nord pour dernier terrain vagueWith the North See as a last wasteland,Et des vagues de dunes pour arrêter les vaguesand waves of dunes to stop the waves,Et de vagues rochers que les marées dépassentand indistinct rocks which the tides overrunEt qui ont à jamais le cœur à marée basseand whose hearts forever remain at low ebb...Avec infiniment de brumes à venirWith an infinity of mists to come...Avec le vent de l'est écoutez-le tenirWhen the wind is from the East, listen how it fights -Le plat pays qui est le mienthis flat land of mine... Avec des cathédrales pour uniques montagnesWith cathedrals for sole mountains,Et de noirs clochers comme mâts de cocagneand black church-steeples for may-poles,Où des diables en pierre décrochent les nuageswhere devils of stone grope for the clouds...[the gargoyles you can find on top of churches]Avec le fil des jours pour unique voyageWith the succession of days as its only journeyEt des chemins de pluie pour unique bonsoirand rain-drenched roads as its only goodnight...[it rains very often in Belgium, like 360days out of 365 !]Avec le vent d'ouest écoutez-le vouloirWhen the wind is from the West, listen how it pines -Le plat pays qui est le mienthis flat land of mine... Avec un ciel si bas qu'un canal s'est perduWith a sky so low that a canal has got lost,[in Belgium, the typical color of the sky is greyish, like the color of water]Avec un ciel si bas qu'il fait l'humilitéwith a sky so low that it fakes humility,Avec un ciel si gris qu'un canal s'est penduwith a sky so grey that a canal has hanged himself,[the grey sky is kind of depressing]Avec un ciel si gris qu'il faut lui pardonnerwith a sky so grey that he must be forgiven...Avec le vent du nord qui vient s'écartelerWhen the Northern gales come blasting down...Avec le vent du nord écoutez-le craquerWhen the wind is from the North... listen how it creaks -Le plat pays qui est le mienthis flat land of mine... Avec de l'Italie qui descendrait l'EscautWith a touch of Italy flowing down the Schelde,[= reference to all the Italian immigrants in Belgium]Avec Frida la Blonde quand elle devient Margotwhen Frieda the Fair turns into Margot[= mix of culture :it means when a Flemish girl(Frieda) plays "Margot" in a French play; we all interact together in Belgium OR frigid Frieda when she becomes a "femme fatale"]Quand les fils de novembre nous reviennent en maiwhen the sons of November return to us in May,[written in 1961, the military service was 18months. Usually it started in November and ended in May 2 years later OR the migrant workers unemployed from Nov to May]Quand la plaine est fumante et tremble sous juilletwhen the plains smoke and tremble under July,[in Belgium, July and August are the hottests, he's talking about the big plains characteristic of Belgium; "trembe" because of the heat and the harvest time]Quand le vent est au rire, quand le vent est au bléwhen the wind is to laughter, when the wind is to wheat,[laughter = time to relax; to wheat : time to work]Quand le vent est au sud, écoutez-le chanterwhen the wind is from the South, listen how it sings -Le plat pays qui est le mien.this flat land of mine...I'm done !

TOPIC: ISSUE221 - "The chief benefit of the study of history is to break down the illusion that people in one period of time are significantly different from people who lived at any other time in history."WORDS: 462          TIME: 00:45:00          DATE: 2008-9-8 15:39:43I concede that the human nature has not changed over the recorded history, and coming to know this fact by studying history, is beneficial to better living in our current society. However, the statement unfairly generalized about the value of history in two respects. First, there still are other markedly different ways in which people in other different periods worked. Second, studying history is not merely beneficial to inform us that the human nature is unchangeable. I agree with the speaker insofar as by study history, we learn that the basic human nature--our desires and motives, as well as our fears and foible-- has never changed over the recorded history. Through study history, we try to summarize a way to prevent the tragedies in our living society, though to no avail. For instance, the history teaches us, the desires and motives of rendering a war have not change from the time of the Crusades to recent Iraq war--to strive for resource from others. Also, the history teaches us, the human mistakes and society illness are here to stay. For instance, the Environment problems would here to stay; the crime and the violence have trouble in every society; all manner to solve or reform are not available even using the most serious punishment, or only with partial success.However beneficial it might be to appreciate the unchanging nature of human being, it is equally important to understand and accept the significant difference between different periods of time, including the insight of culture, customs, social value and ideals. For Instance, the way in which societies treat women have been changing from the elder time to current time. Society's attitudes towards the wars and environment have continuously evolved over the course of human history. Learning the changing and evolution of different societies help us formulate informed, reflective, and enlightened values and ideals for ourselves and the society we are living also benefit as a whole.Another problem of the statement is that it unfairly overlooks other equally important value of the studying history. Through studying the courage and tenacity of great leaders, explores and other great achievers in the history can inspire us to attain the similar achievement in our time, at least it is helpful to reduce the fear when we are facing new troubles in the way of reforming our time. Studying the mistaken of other societies can help us avoid repeating them. For instance, we come to know by studying history that in any democracy a leader who relies on deception and secrecy to preserve that leadership, to advance a private agenda, or to conceal selfish motives, betrays the democracy—and ends up forfeiting the political game. In the other hand, learning about one’s cultural legacy, or roots, fosters a healthy sense of self and cultivates an interest in preserving art, literature, and other cultural artifacts—all of which serve to enrich society.In sum, the history tells us the human nature has not changed over the different recorded history. And the lesson of history can help us improve the connection and tolerance between us and others. However, the history can teach us other things--to help us obtain collect value and ideal when we are eager to change our time.

It's difficult to put everything into just a few sentences, so please help to me make it sound correctly.Thank you!National anthem of the Russian Federation – between the new state and the soviet traditionThe proposal of the Russian Federation president V. Putin to restore in 2000 as national anthem the melody composed by A. Aleksandrov, which previously was the anthem of the USSR, evoked a stormy debate about national symbols of the new state. Part of the society voted for the return to the old athem in order to keep the historical continuity, others opposed, calling in Stalin's crimes as their arguments. Soon after the melody was accepted along with new words. Current work aims to investigate opinion of Polish on russian government's contorversial move as well as to evaluate non-historical values of the old USSR anthem.The Soviet anthem melody undoubtedly complement the triad of Russia's national symbols – its coat of arms comes from the times of building the state by Ivan III and its flag appeared during reign of Peter the Great and Russian Empire's closing relation with the West. The respondents of survey I had conducted higly appreciated values of russian anthem's both music and words: most of people associated the anthem with strong and proud country along with hope for bright future. Comparison with the polish anthem revealed that part of respondents perceives it as out of date. Therefore it is possible that in near future Poland will face the same discussion about national symbols.

Hello, my friend gave me this site and I decided to try it =)Today in the morning I woke up at 9 p.m. in friend's flat. I wash my face and go to computer to check messages in Vkontakte(it's like a facebook but russian) and turn on some music. I started to listen "Rachelle Ferrell"! It's really good music especially when your friends are sleeping. I think it's cool to wake up when you heard some sound of jazz.

When I was elementary school student, at that time rollerskating is so had populared.So I used to play with my friends every day.One day, I played with 2friends rollerskating.Suddenly I slipped and fell, my left ankle sprained.It was really really painful. Two friends approached me and said "are you Ok?" actually I wasnt ok cause I felt nearly die but I replied I'm ok. As It was so painful I couldnt dare to go home alone by walk but my character is a little ______(not outgoing) so I couldnt ask to help me.One friend said me "shall I take you home?"I said by courtesy "no, I can go home alone" (OK!! please..T_T!!)at that time the other friend said to one friend "dont care, she said she can go home alone"Though I was really really painful so I couldnt think anything but then I could think this.. 'Bitch!!' :-(  I could certify our friendship!!! Anyway finally I said I will go home alone and went to home alone nealy creeping. Arrived at home I (kept my bed? confined to my bed?) and next day I wore a cast. After, though I went through that happening I got along with the other friend well but I hate her and really thanked to one friend,First, I still blamed in my mind after parted from her. but since when I dont remember her name just remember the kind friend.

A recent movie recall my memories of like,eighth grade(the 3rd year in junior middle school)? We were assigned to write an article about dreaming.   Then next week on the first period, the teacher was so furious to declare that she found someone's work was definitely the copies from outsiders' public paper.  From thus,I confirmed that there is no such absolutely just recognization really happened so much so often.  And to cheering up the creativity (of the piece of work which is goooood enough to be identified as a knockoff ), I thought I do earn myself a little more boast : people think and act in their routine, that's why they often hide their motivation and always persuade others NOT TO do sth beyond understanding. As time goes by,I find no matter what the truth is,people only see what they want to see.   So, that will be a tough project to make everyone surround you do your interst without hesitation (PS: forgive my abuse of western language if it might be).  They might strike you when you give a prospectus, they just say the opposite when the critical time comes,they can do anything abnormal and trust it or not,always accompanied by reasons.  Is the way as similar as we conclude ?--if one sets his mind to do sth,sooner or later he can find his path & means .The point is we make mistakes,finding ourselves spending time in proving to others that we're not stupid which, on the contrary do the uselessness.The harder we try the more hopeless we feel.  Time flies we all have to move on.  We so bond to have because we are born with nothing and deny failure unconscious of the fact that everything begin with a trust.   So...again,let's spare the time of acknowledging and do it though hard. Last month the Africa PD wanted to have a guy enrolled for him in response to the "dissonance" of the team.Saying this,I never think my english is good,I do not know what is the professional band 8 for,especially when you see so many graduates who was practicing language training from 7 just like us but still don’t know how to extend it.And mostly,I figured all of the world,people communicate without useing word merely,it’s… sort of heart,perhaps.  So like other stupid certification which I might wanna to gain through examination in Oct,I never think it’s a must.Even that I do not speak the beautiful accent like 10years ago,even if I can not express myself clearly to win your support any longer,I just keep the right way I am,and I just believe everyone who has his own will be loved by his circle and destiny.I like the people who accept challenge and willing to explore his extrem. PLUS : this is supposed to be a talk big,but it's not.u r taking the risk of ignoring many so-ture experiences if you think it is.

Walking out of my high school’s dormitory for the last time, I had the both feeling of joy and sorrow. I was happy because I finally finished my senior high school and was going to enter the university. But I felt upset for the fact that I was leaving this memorable place. This dormitory was less a means of living room than an amazing place with unforgettable memories.I started to live in that dormitory in my sophomore year of high school. Our room had 8 beds but only 5 students were living, so there was much extra space in the room. That’s why our friends loved spending their spare time in our room. So from the first day we moved into this dormitory, you could see the scene that at least 10 boys sitting in our room, chatting, and laughing.We had done many interesting things in our dormitory, and the most interesting one was the game of playing “basketball” in the room. We bought a very small dustbin and stuck it to the back of the front door, and it was our “basket”. Also, we brought some ping-pang balls which were used as “basketballs”. From then on, every time we were free, we would play “basketball”. Was it naïve? Yes, I should admit it. But we all loved it and it did bring us joy. We even invited all the boys of our class into our room to play a kind of game called basketball shooting out. Anyone lost would face with the punishment like telling jokes or pretending animals’ behavior, and it made us burst into laughter all the time.Such memorable things always appeared again to my eyesight. I can still remember the day we told jokes one by one and chose who the funniest guy was; I can still remember the day we talked about our favorite NBA team with high emotion till night. And I will never forget that we read books and went over our lessons silently in the room the day before exams; I will never forget that we get together in the room to discuss how to improve study.Friends are people who can share likes and dislikes, joy and sorrow. We felt at ease together and we understood each other. We had a lot of common interests and we could help each other no matter in study or daily life. Once bathed in the warmth of such friendship, you will feel the great power of love.I always considered such kind of getting together as our own party that would never end, but I was wrong. After graduation, we will not live there again. And worse, we were separated because we went to different cities to seek after further study. As the saying goes, we tend to realize the value of what we have had until there is no more of it in our life. Luckily, although we left the high school dormitory, we kept our precious friendship with us. And those days we together were the best experience in my life that I wouldn’t trade for anything. I believe surely that we will get together again and relight the blaze of those happy days.

Please be extremely strict when correcting this text. Thanks!Hey friends!Since I joined this social network I’ve always written my posts in Japanese but today I’ll give English a chance! I’d like to tell you all about something that ocurred a few days ago and that will likely change my life for the better.To fully understand what I’m about to say let’s go back to January for a moment, when I took an interview seeking to participate in a course on innovation and leadership that would be held at my university. According to what people familiar with the matter said to us, after a 4-month period of hard work the students who proved oustanding leadership skills and an uncanny ability to learn would be picked up and sent to different parts of the world to do an internship in the most innovative companies.I was luckly to finally be selected to take part in that particular adventure and I committed to myself to go after that internship and to strive to make my dream of working for a big bank come true.A lot has happened since January. 3 guys and I formed a team and we’ve been working together one session after another. Besides my team mates, they have become my friends. Now they are people I know I can trust and whom I’m sure I will received support from when necessary.Last week I received a call from the person who was in charge of the selection process and asked me one of the most easy-to-answer questions I have ever been asked: “Would you like to work in one of the largest Asian banks next summer?”OF COURSE I WOULD!!!!!!!!It looks like I’ll be working for Bank Mega in Jakarta for 2 months starting on July, 1st. I’ll be using English on a daily basis and thus I decided to brush it up here on Lang-8 ;-)Well... why was I selected? Here is what I think.To be honest with you, I’m not a smart guy. I’m not the kind of student that consistently rises his hand in class and comes up with all the right answers. I don’t have good grades and I don’t even enjoy my classes. Despite studying information technology engineering I know this is not the place I’d like to be. In fact, I have no doubt that once I graduate from university I’ll do something which will bear little or no connection with what I’m currently studying at school.However, I think I’m an intelligent guy. As I said, I don’t have all the answers but... you know what? I do have the right questions. Sometimes it’s not about knowing everything (it’s technically impossible to know everything) but about asking the right questions to the right people. I once was told –or maybe I just read it– that those who now raise their hands and know all the answers will eventually end up working FOR someone who may not be good at solving difficult physics problems but can get and lead the right people effectively towards an even better solution. That’s the type of person I’d like to become.In this Akademia program (the course I took) it was not wisdom what was rewarded, but zeal. The zeal to learn and the potential to thrive internal and externally.Finally I’d like to share some words from Thomas L. Friedman, the 3-times-winner of the Publitzer prize. In his fantastic book “The World is Flat”, Friedman speaks about how the world has changed and why you’re no longer competing for a job position against people from your own city or country. The truth is that you’re now competing against every inhabitant of the world. There’s no room for “a Spanish job” or a “Japanese job”. Those kind of jobs have simply disappeared.One more thing this incredibly brillian journalist tells us in his book is that in a flat world, IQ is gradually giving way to CQ, which stands for Curiosity Quoficient. All your IQ lets you do will be probably outsource to India or China and now it’s your Curiosity Quoficient, your genuine and intense passion for learning new things what really counts out there.I won’t be in Jakarta because of my IQ. I will be there thanks to my CQ.In other words: I won’t be in Jakarta because I know everything. I will be there because I’d love to know it.Thanks for reading my long post and I wish you all a great weekend.P.S. If any of you know anything about Bank Mega please leave a comment! If you don’t, leave it anyway ;-) they are always appreciated.For my original blog please go to: http://guille.exblog.jp

Part 1This is a text about my relation with my flatmate.It´s been a year since I moved to this room.At first we were pretty good friends, but a little after I realized how nasty she was.She has studied pshycology so its supossed that her inteligence level is pretty high.Perhaps she could have an alergy to the soap , I don´t know but she is enable to be tidy, to clean herself other to have a normal behaviour at house.She doesn´t cook, she always wait for other flatmates cooking moments to start thinking what she may have for lunch,usually she eats meals cooked by another one, cause painly we offer our meals to her.I mean, she always want someone to do something.She isn´t able enough to manage herself to do nothing.After eating her main worry is to lay on the sofa , careless if the dishes are clean or not.

Hello everyone, this is my first time on Lang-8. Honestly, i have no idea of what should i write here. haha. First of all I want to tell you that I'm Canadian and where i'm living, there are only French speakers because of this, it's a bit difficult to me to learn English. I really want to learn because I have a lot of penpals who are native English speakers and i'll be meeting them soon. The fact is that we need to speak English and mine is no better than theirs. anyway.. i hope Lang-8s going to help me.

Dear Scholarship Committee, I am writing to you to express my desire to participate in the Scholarship Programme for English Teachers 2010-2011, applying for Teachers Development Course (TDC) at The Anglo.Two years ago, I was granted a scholarship to study the Teacher Training Course and thanks to this training I have had better tools to improve my teaching experience. This training was reflected on my performance -which has been rewarded- and nowadays, I have more responsibilities in the university where I work.  This situation compels me to be updated and better qualified to select, adapt and design language syllabi and material.The TDC syllabi states that after completing the training, the participant will have acquired skills on evaluation material and syllabus design. For those reasons, I am really interested in taking it. Not only can I develop the skills needed at my current job but also I can enhance my comprehension of the teaching-learning precepts in more advanced students -the Achilles’ heel in the majority of language schools. Using both, skills and knowledge, I am sure I will be able to make proposals to help my students to compete with the international standards.However, in this moment, as I am still studying I can't work full time and I do not have a great income to afford the Course. The TDC represents for me an excellent opportunity to continue improving and I wouldn’t like that my financial restraint problem stops me. Due to this situation, I am totally reliant on the generosity of the foundation to be granted the scholarship for the TDC. I am looking forward to receiving the opportunity to study at The Anglo and to make a great contribution to my students. Thank you for considering my application.Yours faithfully, Jessica Viviana Toledo Aranda

(This is a summary of notes for prepare me to civilization test on January. My problems aren't the knowledge but my English expression :/ )After the break up of Soviet Union, Canada became the largest nation in the world.Canada is a federation composed by three territories (Northwest, Nunavut and Yukon) and ten provinces (most famous are Ontario and Quebec for example). Provinces receive their power from the Constitution Act to 1867 and territories receive their power from federal government.Canada resources are mainly woods, potatoes and fair trade, but this last years oil support the economy in Alberta, uranium in Saskatchewan, gold and nickel in Manitoba.In 1999 it’s the creation of the Nunavut “our land” in Inuktitut language. This land is given to them for apologize the destruction to their land and clans by the settlers. After the WW1, many people arrived in Canada but the great depression of the 70s and the WW2 stopped immigration for a while. In 60s a lot of Asians came, and it’s the beginning of race difficulties. In 1971, the government of Pierre Trudeau officialized the multiculturalism policy. They established a government department to promote the multicultural character. When the law became colour blind, more immigrants from Asia and third world country than Europe.The construction of Canada began with the discovery of New France (Quebec).Jacques Cartier wanted to find gold, ordered to find a passage to India “the north-west passage”. He discovered the entrance of the St Lawrence River and found Montreal during 2nd expedition. Samuel Champlain established the first French foot-board in 1608. But few immigrants came.In 1754 it was the beginning of the territory war called “the seven years war” or “the French and Indian war”. The war finished in 1763, with the treaty of Versailles: France gave up its colonies to the British.In 1774, American wanted Canada against British, but Quebec refused to join the revolution. In 1794, British recognised the independence of the 13 colonies, but kept Canada. But, after the independence, a lot of American people moved to Canada, and New Brunswick was founded.After the Constitutional Act of 1791, the territory was divided between Lower Canada (Quebec) with mainly French area, and Upper Canada (Ontario), mainly English area. In 1867, British parliament pasted the British North America act with brought the Canada as a nation. The new nation needed a new capital and Ottawa was chosen by the Queen Victoria because it was between Ontario and Quebec.

I have three children. My elder son is 29, my younger son is 25 and my youngest daughter is 21.I didn’t have good health when I was young, so I was not able to take enough care of my children. However my elder son instead of me took care of his brother and sister. When he was 8, his sister was a baby. He changed her diapers, gave her a bottle and held her in his arms or carried her on his back to sleep. That’s why, she used to watch TV sitting on his laps until she was big enough.Now, my elder son works in Hiroshima, my younger son is a doctoral student in Nagoya and my daughter is a university student in Tokyo.  Though each of my three children lives in each place far from our house, apparently they stay one another. I hope they continue having a good relationship forever.

When I started the Foundation Course I knew almost nothing from what I know now. Researches, ideas development, crits , everything was fresh. I have learnt and tried a lot of new techniques, wrote my first essay about art, started to mix different media to create a new piece, I understand materials and methods in a new level. One of my favourite topics is psychology. I think the most interesting things are hidden deep in our minds. I am fascinated by ideas of surrealist’s, Freud’s studies, fantasy and science-fiction books. The last thing I explored was a book of Jorge Luis Borges, which inspired me to make a research about fantastic stories. The same mood I have found in works of Francesca Woodman, her photography is something mysterious and magical for me. Her works reminded me of a futuristic band “Autechre”. The mood was also created with Jim Henson’s “Labyrinth”, famous “Matrix” made by Wachowski brothers and Tim Berton’s “Sleepy Hollow”. “So, the Labyrinth is a piece of cake, is it? Well, let's see how you deal with this little slice... “ In Part 1 one of my projects was about the edge between reality and the world of dreams, the wall which is destroyed by schizophrenia. I feel that I haven’t finished working on this topic, I want to explore it more. I see the connection between my old project and the idea I have now, I think I can use the research I made before. Moreover ,I won’t repeat mistakes I had in the first project. The topic of my FMP is “Labyrinth of mind”.I want to create a series of accessories for a book: a cover, bookmarks, map, postcards. The book is J.L.Borges’s  “Labyrinth”, which inspired me. This time I want to try printing on fabric and cut-up technique. I also thought of making a small 3D model of labyrinth, which can be completed only with using light, for example make hidden doors, place mirrors etc., which can be founded only in the shadow of labyrinth. I am also interested in using Fluxkits idea, I think I can place all the work in a special box. I am going to look through Borges’s works more carefully and make a research about him as a person. There are a lot of films on the “mysterious labyrinth” topic as well that are worth to watch. I also want to visit History museum and V&A costume section to get even more inspired by costumes of last 3 centuries. I am going to write down in my logbook each step I take ,so I can come back to the original idea and not get lost. I also started to collect questions for questionnaire , but more important questions will appear in process. Of course feedback is much appreciated ,it helps not to get stuck and shows all parts need to develop more.

Not really, no. But I did get really sick last night, so I had to call in sick this morning. It was a pretty bizzare expreince ; not going to work furious and coming home furious. This is my first real job(I've only been working for like 8 months now.) and I've always thought if I didn't sit in front of my work computer in the morning and slave myself the whole world would just crash and burn. GUESS WHAT. That never happened. I think people didn't even notice that I wasn't even there. Okay, at least some people must have complained about it since they were the ones who had to cover for me, but that's it. Not the end of the world. I think I should do this more often; calling in sick. I feel quite better now and am fully charged with the kind of energy that only someone who watched 20 Grey's Anatomy episodes in a row can have. Great day to feel useless and unwanted. Yoo-hoo!

Today, I watched a video clip on internet. A little girl, about 6 years old, stood in a big ice hockey rink with plenty of audience. There was not much to tell from the scene, I guess this probably took place in the U.S. The girl was holding a microphone and singing American national anthem, her voice was innocent and clear like a soft breeze in the summer night. Unfortunately, the microphone failed, I can see her lips moving but without any sound. I really felt anxious about her. I did not know what would happen, would this little accident hurt her feeling with the sense of defeat? The pause was about 5 seconds, then some of the audience began to sing with her, the sound became louder and louder. Still I can see her lips were moving without hearing her voice, but what I can hear probably is love and respect.At that moment, I was touched.

Hi!This is my fist writing on this page. I've been studying English for some time, you know to master a language many skills are necessary such as speaking, listening, reading and writing. These are the so famous 4 skills to learn languages and sometimes it can be really hard to master them.However, it also depends on the amount of time that you dedicate to learning the language which you're interested on. It's obvious that you won't reach a good level in a short time if you don't practice a few hours everyday.It is said that some languages are easier to learn. In my opinion, it also depends on your native language. For example for many westerners is a lot easier to learn English,French,Italian and Spanish because these languages come from Latin, being known as romance languages. But learning Chinese, Korean or Japanese can be hard as hell, cause we aren't familiar with those weird,strange symbols.So, for Japanese people is really hard learning English because they aren't familiar with most words and their pronunciation isn't as flexible as English pronunciation.When I became aware of this page I thought that it could be very handy to practice my English as well as my Japanese and in exchange, help many people learning my native language which it is Spanish.So, thank you very much for reading my first writing in English. :DAh! by the way, my nickname is Michard,nice to meet you.

Title:Do you think it is easier to succeed nowadays than it was in the past?Along with the acceleration in rate of the modern society and the growth of the trend of globalization, the opportunities to achieve success in certain fields are widely believed to be increasing. Objectively speaking, I hold the perspective that it is easier to achieve success than it was in the past.Advanced policies in modern society enhance education opportunities for the public. The tendency of which sexual and racial discriminations are undergoing a decline enables a larger scale of people to obtain higher education. A general study conducted in 2007 indicates that the number of educated people in developing countries has increased steeply by a substantial percentage of 32.4% in the past 5 decades. The widely acknowledged perspective, which proved even more evidently by enormous facts nowadays, that a person’s education is the most crucial aspect of his or her life appears to be so extensive that people even equate success in life with level of education. It is authentic that education contributes directly to enhancing their job opportunities of promotion opportunities while improves self-condition when reaching for success. From that perspective, modern society provides superior conditions in educational for people to achieve success.Another convenience modern society brings for those who are seeking for success is its technological innovations. As stepping into the informational era, an era of extraordinary sophistication and versatility, we are experiencing the unprecedented rate of acceleration of technology which is turning what used to be mission-impossible into a simple matter of talent and willingness of hardworking, not concerning barriers in technique. Through a book-sized laptop can we easily obtain information from the very corners in the world within a blink of an eye, while by clicking fingers may we gain the latest statistics on a study from the other side of the globe. Telecommunications, Internet, and related cutting-edge technology are making it simpler and more convenient to do studies and achieve for success.Moreover, advance in technology also brings wider range of investment and career, which provides a larger scale for people to obtain achievements and more opportunities to enjoy success.We can cite the now common example of the extensive demands from the society towards the technicians of high caliber in the field of IT------ Information Technology. From this point of view, we can infer that modern society also provides a wider stage for people of high caliber to perform themselves.From what has been discussed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that it is undoubtedly easier to succeed nowadays than it was in the past because of the advantages modern society provides.

West Lake, one of the most famous places of interests, lie in the southwest of Hangzhou. It is a good description of this densely wooded, rich and warm city of China.You can cross the Yangzi-Triangle Plain by train, which will just take one and twenty minutes from SH, a metropolitician city. For the best view of the West Lake, take a boat, wandering in the water that will at times seem never-ending. You can embark on the train any time from Shanghai Southern Railway Station, in the southern part of this city, by Line-3 or Line-1 from downtown. If you'd like to enjot the long stretch of countryside nearby, I recommend you to take a slower train at  a nice comfortable speed, where you still get to see the countryside rolling by.After a short sleep, a middle size but convenient city will finally rise up in the end. Even though it does not have subway like Shanghai, you can find that the transportation here is even better than you expect. Hope all of you will have a nice trip in Hangzhou, my second hometown!

Hello! This is my first of many entries. Currently, I’m studying English in the USA. I think it’s a great opportunity to study a language in its source country, right? I’ve been studying English since 1st grade. I like people correcting my writing in Spanish and English. Usually, I use Word’s spelling check, but sometimes when you correct it the meaning of the sentence changes. So, I also like friends and other people to check it for me so I can have a different opinion about it. I really like writing in the Internet. What I normally use is Facebook and Twitter; hopefully I’ll like posting here in Lang-8 too! This is a new experience for me, because on the other WebPages I have privacy settings and only some people can read my posts; in here I hope to get as many opinions as possible to improve as much as I can.

I am living in Berkeley, California. This town and Sanfrancsico have a lot of homeless people, although I do not know the exact number.I realized one thing about the homeless issue. I have not seen Asian aand Latino homeless people in California, even though there are a lot of Asian and Latino in this state. Of course, I have seen Japanese homeless in Japan. But there is few Japanese homeless in the U.S. Are Asian and Latino richer than other Americans? No. One hypothesis is that minorities tend not to become homeless.  Minorities are connected strongly within their ethnic group. They are minorities, but they are not alone, they help each other.   to be continued...

Hi, everybody!This is my first blog in English and I hope it will help me to improve my writting skills. Today I've finished reading 'Time Traveler's Wife' and I liked it a lot. The last several month I'm trying to read all the books in English to develop the voсabulary. Reading is helping me to remember some collocations and interesting expressions. For instanse I found it very funny how 'icecream' can become a joke like 'I scream and you scream'. Not too much fantasy for today, I'll try to write more lately.

But then I realized it was the interesting one; therefore, I have registered here.As of my English, I've been learning it for already 1 year. People say I'm making a big progress, but I don't think so. Because my spoken English is still poor. I often talk to native speakers, but as a matter of fact, i don't understand them too much. What would you advise me? Thank you in advance.

I think there exists Friendship between men and women.But threre are more opotunities when it disappears than that between men and men.I think Men　naturally have an instict to see　their female friends as sexual targets to a greater or lesser extent.And after an accident, their relationships cannot help but changing. But I want to believe even if there exist no contact between them,but if they　feel they are important to each other, their relationships is able to be called friendships.

During all the 19th century and later, numerous immigrants have rushed to the USA. They all trusted in the following belief : the American dream.The American dream is the idea that consists of thinking that anybody can easily become rich with nothing but hard work in America. Indeed, the fact that someone gets all benefits of his work is part of the liberal economic politic of the USA.So that, it is possible to completely enjoy the Amrican way of life.By the way, this point is the main reason that makes immigrants leave their country. In fact, they try to improve their condition by working in America. Because of that, the USA are usually considered as an "Eldorado".The phenomenon began as some people actually made their way from nothing. For instance, Andrew Carnegie ended up becoming a man of influence in the midst of the steel industry during the 19th century whereas he began as a mere worker in a textile factory.

Hi there!My name is Esteban and I'm writing here for the very first time... I was dragged here by Tofugu this certain guy who vloggs and gives away resources to those who are self-teaching themselves Japanese online. Textfugu, is his website. Good that I knew him so I can give it a try to this Lang-8 thing. I am also fond of Japan and Korea but at the time I am not studying these languages although I expect to start studying them soon. In the mean time I'll write over here to perfect my English. Actually "perfect" is a word too heavy to carry around. I'll say then that I want to learn more and more! :D It's been aproximately 4 years since I formally started studying English but I almost never have the chance to be corrected when I practice either because my friends are too kind to me or because I don't usually write letters or any document in English or beacause I am not understood. :(I want to write over here every now and then and become more confident in my writing. Also I really enjoy practicing and sharing stuff in this my second language. I look forward to being corrected and to have my most common mistakes pointed out. I think I can take that as long as you don't go too hard on me. I thank you all in advance and I hope to know more about you over here. I am at your disposition if you ever need a native Spanish speaker. I'm from Mexico BTW but since I study literature (esp. playwriting) I think I can be very useful if ever required by you no matter which spanish you are learning.  My spelling is one little problem I have and that is one thing I believe is important for me to be advised in. Since I've been learning from teachers who thaught both American and British English the outcome of my writing might be a strange strange mixture them. I want to be consistent with BrE since the last two years I've been learning under a British-like system, but well, that's too much to say in a firts entry.I know it might be difficult to explain to me every error y might do... so I thank you again if you can comment me.Oh boy am I nervous!!

Nice to meet you!I love cello, fursal and engineering. I am a student of University in Fukuoka. Please not be afraid of contact me.In todays diary, I will write about my getting a new favorite song.I got the song in Nagoya at 2 :00 p.m. on last Tuesday. In Japan, last two weeks in the year are called "Golden weeks." Japanese people can have a short vacation in these weeks and tmany of hem enjoy their refreshment. Then I also took refreshment in last Tuesday. I went to Nagoya to listen to classical concert by a lot of cello players. One of　them is my previous teacher of cello and there are professional cello player and students from kinds of schools. The youngest player is 13 years old. They all have great techniques for playing cello.   I found that a lot of songs are very beautiful and they can move very big in the concert. One of them is very impressive for me. The song is composed by David Popper "Polonaise de concerto op.14 arranged by S. Van Eck." The song was arranged for four cello players. The player in the concert are all professional cellists or a graduate school student majoring cello (she is very charmy girl and I was attracted during all of the concert). They are crazy for making music. I was very attracted by the gir...sorry, by the song played by them. They made very good ensemble and their atmosphere very excite me and made my face veery happy and smile during the whole of the song.  The song is very exciting, so please listen to at once(^^). Youtube has a video of that song(for only one cello and a piano.)  It becomes one of my favorite songs list.yeah!!

Currently I’m a member of the Civil Industrial Engineering program at the XXX  University , studying  my last semester which ends in December of the present year. At the time that I should chose a specialization of the career I opted to join the mention of energy and environment with some notion of how important it could be these issues in the following years. My suspicions were confirmed with the argentine gas supply crisis, the high prices of fossil fuels and high CO2 emissions from traditional power generation, which has made energy a priority issue for the economic, social and environmental development of the country.Since that time I have focused my career in the energy area, particularly in renewables energies, which presents a friendly alternative to the environment. Evidence of this was the realization of my professional practice in XXX, enterprise of solar energy projects located in Spain, one of the pioneering countries in the implementation of renewables energies such as wind and solar power. In addition, through my engineering thesis I continued my research in renewables energies and, particularly, in the feasibility of a large-scale solar power plant in Northern Interconnected System in Chile, topic that has so far not been addressed in our country.Your master`s program is an excellent opportunity to continue my improvement in this field, increasing my knowledge and improving my skills. Moreover, as international experience, it would be a instance to learn good practices and take new ideas. I addition,  your university is known as one of the best in the world, emphasizing its quality in the area of science and engineering and it has been highly recommended by my professors and others engineers that I have known.A master's course abroad would allow me to grow professionally and deliver me the opportunity to contribute to my country in the energetic development, with a focus on the matrix diversification and decreasing the dependency on fossil fuels. All of this under a sustainable stance, environmentally responsible and with a marked preference for non-conventional renewables energies.

A soft white rabbit was jumping happily in a forest. The ground, covered by flowers in bloom, remained listening his little feet resounding in the silence. There were no more sounds along the lonely forest and the bunny just kept jumping. He was completely focussed on his goal: find that peaceful green plain with a powerful waterfall where he found the thing. That dazzling strange thing that awakes his curiosity.Suddenly, the rabbit stopped. A persistent sound of water falling started to overcome his senses. The thing was just a few steps away...

(note : Tomoya is a boy)Let's recapitulate : Tomoya's mother dies in his early childhood. His dreams of being a basketball player are shattered by his father who accidentally breaks his shoulder. Then, Tomoya's father, full of angst, drinks and wastes his money at gambling. Then Tomoya marries Nagisa, sees her dying by childbirth at home while a snow tempest blows outside. Then he leaves his daughter Ushio to her grandparents until he wakes up five years later and takes her back from them so they can finally cry for their daughter. And finally, Ushio, who was pretty healthy until then, suddenly becomes ill and dies in the street in his father's arms (under the snow, of course). At this rate, a third season of Clannad might feature :- the Furukawas' bakery burning down to the ground (with them in it)- a major earthquake crumbling down the whole city while Tomoya is hunting starfishes at the beach- and end with a homeless and drunk Tomoya dying, eaten alive by boars. And more snow.

Hello world, nice to meet you :)My acquaintance to English began when I was at the elementary school. I didn't like this subject at all, I thought "Oh dear, so boring..."But in one day I fell in BIG love (let me say that x) ) with the Beatles. I wanted to know more and more about them, and, in addition, I wanted to know what are they singing about. So, from that moment, I began to learn English seriously... and with pleasure :) Honestly, now I have some troubles with different aspects of the language. Prepositions and punctuation for example. Or TIMES - oh, they're really scarring me xD But I hope that here I will be able to improve my English - with a little help of my friends ;-)Also, few days ago I have started to learn Korean. Because of the music band too xD It's my karma, probably? :)

I wish I will get a good work near my home.      My teacher told us the Economic crisis will stay a very long time, so many people have lost their jobs.        Another thing is that there are about 10000 students come to our school to find about 200 jobs.       Let me see. Maybe I will go around our country to find one.

This week was filled with a lot of things.First, last Wednesday I did an exam at the university. But the context was the one of a movie. All that day was raining. I went to the workplace (office) with the company of a soft water falling from a silver cloud. At lunch, a thin rain induced me to buy a delicious dish (empanadas). When I was going to the university, it was raining really hard, and I got a headache. I solve the exam really fast, and then I went home, to slept.The last Thursday I had to inscribe me to the courses of this semester. I choose some subjects, that will allow me to keep working while studding. my career, engineering, really takes time to be completed, and it is really easy to lost years if you do not pass one subject in time. Some times, because of being at work, you could not assit and looses exams, just a little problem, with a big impact on your life.I started this week to study, I feel condifent I will have a nice semester.A good news is that a coworker lend me a book about kanji... all written in japanese. It will take time to digest it, but it will be so sweet to read it that I am really happy about that.Nowadays my current topic at Japanese is to end learning katakana, that is why I have to wait until I could learn more vocabulary, verbs in particular.

Yestreday I joined this Lang-8.In Japan, the most popular SNS is "mixi".The character of mixi is many kinds of comunities, like life, foods, thinking, hobbies, etc...Now we do not have many comunities in Lang-8 especially about entertainment and hobbis.Most of communities are languages.So I created 3 communities as Playstation3, Japanese sports cars, and Plastic kit modeler.If we talk about particular topic which we are interested in, that is the best way to learn other languages, I believe. (and it is fun)Lets create various communities if you do not find the best one!

Today, I started to read the book I bought yesterday. It's called "Les kanjis dans la tête" : it is the French version of "Remembering the Kanji" (by James Heisig), written by Yves Maniette.During last months I learned ひらがな (hiragana) and カタカナ (katakana). Then I looked for a good method to begin 漢字 (kanji). As usual, that took me a while, because I want to compare every book, every method, reading opinions on every forum I could find. I spent much more time for Kanji because learning more than two thousand ideograms the bad way could be, well, "catastrophic".I wondered if I should learn main pronunciations or if I should follow Heisig and Maniette's thoughts : just associate a kanji with a keyword and some "sesames".Finally, I decided to use the kdlt book with Anki, a spaced repetition system.I have to say that the book is really beautiful. It worthes its price. And the method seems to work well ! I learned twenty-five kanji today, and if I didn't want to take my time I would have learnt more. It's really exciting, and easy to read.I should know all of the 2064 kanji the book teaches in about three months. I know the most part of the work is to learn words using these characters, because, in opposition to English, I don't read Japanese every day, I know just about ten words, and there aren't "transparent words". But let's think about that later. :)

Yesterday, I went to Shenzhen for an interview,seeking a new job. I was quite nervous during the part of self-introduction which is my first time to introduce myself in English. I felt quite regret that I didn't perform well, so I'm not sure whether the owner will employ me or not. The job sounds good job for an internship, except that I have to leave this place(my campus) to a strange city where I don't like much. Shenzhen is too noisy for me. It seems that I've graduated before June next year. I don't want to leave those people I have got to known so much. One day I'm sure that I will miss all of you guys here. But I still hope that I could get the job.

Hi everybody! I'm Carla and I'm from Valencia, Spain. Yesterday, I thought: "I have to practice my English!" So I am here. I wanted to write something in this website, but I do not have any idea. So I thought to start a kind of diary. However, when I was a child I started a lot of diaries, and... well, I only wrote two or three pages.But this is different. It is writen in English! I think it could be... funny? Interesting? I don't know! Time will say it.How can I start? As I said, my name is Carla. I have eighteen years old and this is my first year at the University. Now, we have just started the second term, and I have changed completely all the subjects. Last term I had English, Spanish, Catalan, Traductology and Classic Culture. Now, I have English, too, Linguistics, Literature, Technology and Philosophy- don't ask me why I have it.This week I knew some of the results of the exams. I have an A in three of them!- I don't know the others yet.I am watching the time and I realise that... I have a lot of homework! I have to read two texts, do a summary for the English class and write a letter for an English friend (I will tell my visits to England another time). I think... Maybe the next time it could be called "A kind of autobiography"!Bye!

In Russia there are only two big cities: Moscow and SPB(St.Petersburg), these cities are under federal subordination and life there and others regions is very different. As a joke we say: "DC-1 and DC-2", it means DC-1 (default city) is Moscow, and DC-2 is SPB. If you see at some forum "Why today are a lot of traffic?" you may be sure it means about Moscow.

It isn't easy to explain when you feel lonely but sometimes everybody i think have felt that. I don't know why i feel lonely if i have a great family, good friends, i do my hobbies etc. I though that i have proved everything for feel good myself, although i have never had love!, this is the problem i think. In my opinion love it's a important thing of your live although your friends say sometimes it's a shit they told me that they had a girlfriend and they couldn't do nothing that they like to do, despite of fact that i would try news experience like love!. when i lack something for being happy it's when i'm in loneliness, it's terrible becuase you are sad and very negative. Loneliness it's silence like if you would be in a solitary gigant countrised , sitting near of big tree while i read a book and waiting for someone but sunset and fall the night it's cold and you don't have nobody give you hot. The first part of loneliness it's good but if loneliness extend more time the night will be terrible, dark, shadow, cold,so you feel lonely when it's night in the countryside.  definetly just the life.

Imagine if any countries had police, how would be our lives? In my opinion the police represent a hard role giving us their help and also making our lives less dangerous.First of all, the role of police in my country is not the best service compared with the role of police in New York. In Colombia when some people have trouble hesitate to call the police because this takes almost an hour to arrive and therefore this does not help much. Furthermore is not common to see the police on the street or near home that is why in my country people feel insecure about asking the police for help and is also the last option that people think for helping. On the other hand the role of police in New York is much better because you can see their work in different places. Probably this is because New York has many rules and laws that the police should enforce; perhaps that is why some people in the U.S hesitate to call the police for help because depending on the severity of the problem also depends on how long the process will take in case you have to go to court. In New York whatever where you go you can find the police, then you can feel more confident and secure asking the police for help.Therefore, I think that the best way for solving the problems or some questions is calling the police.

I had so many things to do that I had no time to keed a diary, but I wanna write as frequent as I can from now on:-PI often visit Kagawa known for  Udon for my part- time job.  My friend who lived in there for 8 years took me to a noodle shop.  Although it was a very old and small shop, there were many people.  I ate Udon and tempra.  There were noodle, a raw egg and green onions in the bowl and I added soy sause in it.  It looked simple, but it was delicious!  I wanna eat it again:-) On another note, we held a birthday party for my friends.  It was a surprise party!  We bought two birthday cakes and put them in a bar, we're going to hold a party before we went to there.  We could drink all we want for 3000 yen there, so we ate and drunk too much!  Maybe...we gained at least 1 kilograms.  OMG!!  We have to exercise!  A few hours later, we took cakes out.  They're so impressed.  It made me happy＼(^o^)／  We enjoyed the party.  After that, we went to karaoke.  We sung and laughed!  We sung English songs too.  It was difficult, but it was interesting(^^♪  I wanna be able to sing them better★!  Anyway, it was a amazing day!

Hello. I'm Michiko &am a Japanese. In Japan, We have a interesting proverb '名は体を表す' Na ha Tai wo Arawasu. It means Names and Natures do often agree. Or Name is omen.Recently, I found such a article in BBC news. Children's names 'spell trouble'Some names have good or bad associationsJordan, K'tee, Kloe and Bobbi-Jo are all names to make some teachers' hearts sink, apparently.Teachers have confessed to making snap judgements about children from their names on the register.In a light-hearted debate on a teachers' website, they have listed the names they associate with problematic and charming pupils.Poppys are seen as hyperactive, Kayleighs as a pain and Ryans as hard work, according to chat on the website of the Times Educational Supplement.Kyle, Liam, Wayne, Charmaine and Charlie are among the names teachers say they associate with problem children.One teacher wrote: "I went through my new class list and mentally circled the ones I thought would be difficult.

Good listKate, Gregory, Sean, Charlotte, Jamie, Daniel, Lucy, Isobel, Ben, Sam, Harpreet, Imran, Asam, Alice and JosephAccording to the website, names which get a negative response from teacher include those with hyphens, like Bobbi-Jo, ordinary names with unusual spellings such as Kloe or K'tee, Kristopher, Jayne, Gyaike and Chevaughn, plus the various spellings of Jordon.Names which teachers associate with delightful children include Kate, Gregory, Sean, Charlotte, Jamie, Daniel, Lucy, Isobel, Ben, Sam, Harpreet, Imran, Asam, Alice and Joseph.However, perhaps proving that one's response to a name is dependent on one's personal experience, many names appear on both lists.

(Kobayashi means a Japanese common sir name.) I agreed it since my Kobayashi san are quiet,too! lolAnyway, Of course, It's silly you judge just their name. But I can understand vaguely that a name has some tendency...Guys, what do you think?!I wanna know your opinion!Thanks!

ooh. I don't like when anybody ask me about my summer or 'how I spent my summer holidays'. It's not interesting. I mean, I hate to tell how I rest. Probably, It's seems so strange and weird. So, my summer was a little boring. I became older, now I'm nineteen. It's upsets me so much. Also, I don't like hot weather, I prefer cold and raining. Tastes are so different as you know. And finally, I understood, what I want from my life, but I can't tell you about it. It's personal, I think. But I'm glad that my summer was such stupid and may be boring, It doesn't matter. I understood that I actually had a pretty good time. That's all.

I translated some of the dragon tales in Chinese mythology these days. Limited to personal level, mistake can’t be avoided. Please correct. Thanks!The Defeated Dragon KingLong time ago, there was an old fish man whose family name was Shen lived in Shen Jiamen which was only a desolate hill at that time. The old fish man made a scanty living to feed his wife and daughter by fishing every day.One day the old fish man went to the sea by his boat. He casted his net to the sea several times but he got nothing. As it got darker and the wind also became stronger the old fish man knew that he’d better go back right now or else he might encounter danger. But he hesitated as he knew his whole family was waiting for him hungrily. At the time when he felt awkward he saw a flock of seabirds flying over nearby. He knew “where there are the seabirds, there are schools of fish” from his years of fishing experiences. The old fish man hurried to cast his net there but he got nothing still. He felt frustrated and decided to go back home. Suddenly he found something glowing in his net. He pulled it out and learnt that it was a nicely carven seal made of jade. There was a splendid gold dragon coiling the seal with an extremely bright pearl in its mouth and also some unreadable curving characters. Oddly enough, with the glow of the pearl the sea unexpectedly became calm and the boat sailed steadily also. Ah! The seal was a treasure! With this thought the old fish man kept the seal into his purse and went back home happily.

Summer, 1690s, London , England  ‘Amy…’ She could hardly recognize her own voice, hoarse and weak-willed. It seemed to sound through a shroud of mist, penetrating a prism of pain and distorting.         It was someone’s warm palm that covered her own right hand. She gave a start and opened her eyes. It was a beautiful day and an unknown window of a room she was in. The sunshine was so bright that she couldn’t even distinguish the features of the girl who was sitting by her and holding her hand.       ‘So… Does it mean that I’m dead?’ ‘Oh, no. Not yet. But you are far away from the sea.’       These words made her soul shrink in pain, but the reason was unknown. The lady set in a cosy armchair and now it was possible to see her face good enough to find out that she’s young and beautiful. Ginger hair and hazel eyes, smiling rosy lips…She had seen her face before. She was dressed like a man: she wore a shirt with wide sleeves, black trousers, a vest and boots. ‘Amy Brown…This is your name, isn’t it?’ she asked. ‘It is. But do you remember your own?’ Ms Brown smiled lightly. She felt terrified. No…no…she didn’t know that! What has happened to her? What on earth could make her forget? ‘I don’t…Do you know it?’       ‘We have been together, side by side for such a long time that I couldn’t forget it even if I would like to, Anna Welling.’ She said it ironically though her voice sounded kindly. ‘Where am I and why am I here?’Now she could control herself and her voice good enough to seem confident. ‘The time to discuss that hasn’t come yet. You should put your life in order. Though…there has never been order in your life.’ Amy smoothed her hair. ‘Amy Brown, please! You know me better than I do. Tell me what you know!’ said Anna persistently.    But the girl only shook her had, stood up and walked towards the window disappearing in the sunlight. ‘Wait! I beg you…’   ‘Amy!’Anna sprang to her feet and ran towards the door. Her heart was pounding fastly, as she opened it.‘Calm down, my dear…’ said a quiet man’s voice from behind. Anna turned in surprise and noticed an old man sitting in the armchair, where Amy set some minutes ago.       ‘I can’t understand!’ she touched her temple. ‘But where is Amy?’ ‘It depends on who is she, my darling.’ He came nearer and looked in her face. ‘So who is she?’       ‘I don’t know.’ She felt silly.       ‘However, you do remember her name. And yours? Do you remember it too?’ ‘My name is Anna. Anna Welling.’       ‘Oh, good. Very good,’ he smiled. ‘And I am Doctor Nicholas Beliford.’Mister Beliford, could you tell me, where am I? ‘Of course, my darling. You are in Mrs. Havilland’s mansion not far from London .” ‘ London ?’ she repeated in surprise. ‘You shouldn’t think so much. You’d better rest. And I’ll go to Mrs Havilland to tell her that you feel better. That’s good news for her.’ He opened the door and left Anna alone to face with her growing panic.     The ceiling was white and decorated with stucco mouldings. The wainscots were made of light wood so that the room was unusually lit by the sun. The only window was high and its upper part was a circle of glass of golden colour. Elegantly carved furniture and everything around her looked luxurious but Anna knew that she wasn’t used to such lifestyle.      She touched her chest and came across a silver chain with a medallion on it ‘A familiar thing,’ she thought, looking at the red gem in the middle. A light press-and it opened. “Anna Marie Elizabeth Welling”- were the words engraved inside. It was her name. She could remember nothing except two names: Anna Welling and Amy Brown, her own and...whose? The medallion clicked under her fingers hiding its secret. Anna approached to a large mirror and began examining herself. She had wavy brown hair and green eyes with golden sparkles in them. There was a grin on her lips, and it looked like it was her usual face. Though she had strong arms and was really well built, the white shirt she was dressed in couldn’t hide the fact that such kind of constitution could fit a lad better than a maid.      In the afternoon Anna talked to the hostess, Amanda Havilland, who was a pleasant woman with golden hair and always smiling face. She told Anna a strange story that was the only explanation of her being here. She had been having a voyage with her partner but a sudden storm had broken their plans. A strange storm, a deserted island and a girl near the water looking like she was dead. Those were the facts. And they were not consoling. So the only thing Anna could do now was staying with lady Amanda, who was very kind to her.    Some days later Mrs. Havilland was having guests. Anna was introduced as one of her numerous nieces. She was well-mannered and was good at playing the harp and accompanying Mrs. Havilland’s singing. A young man, Captain Richard Blackenstar, couldn’t look away. Anna felt his gaze and wondered if he could know her before. In the evening she took her chance to slip out and went to the garden. She expected the young man to come. And he was there. ‘The evening is cool,’ she said.       ‘Cool but amazing. But there is no need walking here, if you feel cold. We can join the others.’‘Not now. I would like to ask you, sir…Have we ever met before?’ ‘I am sure, we have not. If I had met you before, I would never have forgotten.’                After that day Mr. Blackenstar visited Mrs. Havilland two or three times. Lady Amanda looked happy and was really in high spirits. It was a pretty thing for her: love. As for Anna, she couldn’t understand how she felt. She learned that love and even care were feelings just incomprehensive. She found out that she was rather strong-willed and even imperative though she tried not to show these qualities to those who surrounded her now. She knew she used to command. But in what way? The one thing she knew exactly was that the day when she will recollect all her previous life is going to turn everything upside down.                                                                            ***       One gloomy day Anna was walking along a narrow street in London . She had to pay for Lady Amanda’s dress. She did it a half an hour ago and now enjoyed her freedom. It was exciting to feel free.The by-street she crossed was dark and muddy. The only one thing that attracted her attention was a sign of a little inn made of copper. The door of the inn creaked and a man walked out. He looked drunk and Anna tried to pass him as quick as she could but he looked right into her face surprisingly. ‘So…Is that you, Anna?’ he asked.       ‘W..what?’ she couldn’t believe he knew her. ‘Why did you come back again? Are you not afraid of being imprisoned, Captain Welling? I’ve never seen you dressed like that. This pretty gown suits you. ’ he laughed. ‘Do you know me, sir?’ she asked cautiously. ‘What did you say? Sir?’ he laughed again. ‘Don’t pretend you see me for the first time. If you are here on the business of your own, just say so.’ Then he turned and walked away.         Anna stood stock-still. She could not say a word. But now she recalled the night of her escape, the burning ships of her father’s, her revenge and her new life full of freedom. A life of a pirate. ‘Stop, Dick!’ she said firmly and the man turned to her. ‘I changed my mind.’ She could hardly recognize her confident voice. ‘Are there any boats you can offer? Let’s get out here. I’ve found out an interesting thing. I’m sure Chris and Amy will come here soon. Oh, I missed her…so much!’       ‘Eh? Whom? D’you mean miss Brown?’ asked Dick with a smile on his face.       ‘No, fool! I mean my boat, of course…My beloved Midnight Star.’   In the evening Anna came back and tried to behave as usual. Mrs. Havilland handed her a letter from Richard Blackenstar in which he wrote that he had to leave England for a while. ‘Don’t be so sad, my dear,’ said the woman to her. ‘It’s just because of his service.’ Anna didn’t regret, of course.                                                                                         ‘Is the reason piracy?’ she asked with a faint smile. ‘Yes, it causes too many problems. What disgrace!’ Lady Amanda threw up her hands. Anna looked at the window. Now she had an idea of what to do. Late at night she went to her bedroom, changed her clothes and now looked like a boy. She sat at the table and wrote a letter:  Dear Mrs Havilland, I cannot express how grateful I am to you for your saving me, taking care of me and for those wonderful days we spent together. But now it is time for me to go. My trip to London helped me to make decision. I met people, who know me, and they are ready to help me return my past. It’s a pity I can’t thank you for all you did for me and it is much worse that I must tell you the truth. My real name is Anna Marie Elizabeth Welling, and I wish I could forget it for ever to live in peace. But I can’t do anything with it. Anyway, my fate will find me. That is why I must go now. It is the way to my real life. The only way. You can act like you consider better. I’ll always be thankful for your kindness.   Please, remember me to Richard and tell him that we are sure to meet sooner or later.                                                                                                 Sincerely yours,                                                                                                                  Anna.            She took a red rose from the vase on the table and put it on the sheet of paper. It was a broad grin on her face when she jumped out the window and walked through the garden. Of course, it will be funny to tell Amy about that wonderful dinner and the guests delighted with her playing the harp. May be, it was the last time she did it. She hoped so. Dick is waiting for her on the cross-roads. She was in danger again. Captain Blackenstar didn’t notice the notorious female pirate Anna Welling under his very nose. She had a good chance to start from the beginning and change her life. But there was no reason for that. This country deprived her of everything she loved. She had to settle a score and she was not going to give up.

Travelling abroad is more and more popular in China now.The number of people travelling abroad has increased rapidly since 1996,thanks to the development of economy.In my opinion,travelling abroad is agreeable.But some Chinese tourists behave badly in public.On the grassland,you may find some Chinese tourists throwing rubbish here and there,which makes the palce dirty.Sometimes some Chinese tourists spit at a venture.These behaviors are not impolite.I don't like them at all.Though China is making rapid progreess in economy, in honsty,none of countries will welcome it if some Chinese people still behave badly in public.It's our duty to develop a good habit in public to get rid of bad behaviors,and to make China a more powerful country.

When I was a little girl,I met you.You were a so so handsome and sunshine boy.Then I fell the love river with you...That was the happiest time in my life.Everyday,when I woke up,I could saw you beside me.What's the happiness?I thought that it stand for stand by you...But,the happy times always be fast.You left me at last...although I didn't want to let you go,you already didn't loved me then.I still love you now,but you have been away for a long time.So,I only can say:'When I love you...'

Three days before I found a music video of my favorite groupe through internet (You tube).Four marionets play Coldplay's song. This music video is best one 2009 at the present. Because the situation of little town's festival is like a old tv series and expressions of people in this video are hyper good. I was laughed by children's blank look, and also the priest is best actor.The remakable stage effects and stage staff (marionets) are valuable for watching.I recommend the ending of this video, it gives you unforgettable impression. The girl wearing glasses with braid hair will be get awards.It goes without saying that this song is fabulous.I loved their music videos, especially "Yellow" 2000. Time pass rapidly,  I remenbered what I was in that year.And now I'm getting older, but I'd love to see Chris Martin ten years after.

I'll talk to you about one of my job/hobbyI'm an illustrator which means I make artwork to sell and survive in this life. In order to complete an illustration from the beginning to the end, I work  with 50/50 traditional and digital items. Traditional ones are : a big sketch block +  0.5 automatic blue pencil + 0.5 automatic pencil. In the other hand, digital items are: a cheap scanner + Corel Painter 11 or Photoshop CS3 (depending on my mood and the brushes I need to get the work done) and finally, my beloved wacom tablet.I won't tell you about the whole process of creating an image from 0 to 100 because that is a story for another entry , wait and see, dear audience, wait and see ;) This entry concerns something that, somehow, surprised me some time ago and I noticed that the tip of my penmouse is running out(?) !! I bought my brand new wacom tablet 4 years ago and I thought the penmouse would last FOREVER. How wrong I was, I wish you could see it by yourself but my digicam doesn't have macro shot system . I'll be buying a new penmouse this coming friday and I'll be happy once again.PS: In case you're wondering what the heck is a "wacom tablet and penmosue", I attached a picture for you.Thank you for reading (and correcting me)

Several years ago famous mathematician Arnold refused to enter Popes academy because they did not justify Jordano Bruno.They told him that religion does not argue with science about what science could proof, but when something is not known, or could not be known to science they are in power to decide what to think about that, and so Bruno thought that there are many worlds with life on those worlds and that was a heresy, and stayed heresy until recently.Now Vatican tells us that aliens does not confront with orthodox.Does that mean that they got scientific proof of an alien being true or they have some serious reason to think that this is true?

I know it is a very difficult task for me to write a diary in English, but I felt a terrible impulse to finish it. I went to EF to get an English test yesterday. I had already realized I need to improve my English before the test. I can only speak a few short sentences even just words during the speaking test with the foreigner. Then the consult advised me some suitable courses, but the price is so high that I can not afford it by myself. The fact is that if I want to raise my English level I must pay a mount of time on exercises, or I might not get any increase.It is always said practice makes perfect. Whatever I do I must pay energy and time to do with patient. Although I have the freedom of time I never use it effectively and nearly waste it at will.  I will leave Zhejiang University in a year and half when I get my master degree. I don’t hope I get nothing form ZJU during the two and a half year’s study. I hope I can receive an increase not only in knowledge but also in capability such as practice and language. Anyway , there is a long way for me to work steadily. Well, fighting~

I can't remember how many times I've tried to write journals in English regularly. Usually I would tell myself: "You need to improve your written English, you have to write something, if you don't, you will screw up your career sooner or later in the future". My future plan is to get into US graduate schools and study social science, so I made a decision that I would write in English everyday, yet I never carried it out longer than 2 days. However, this time after I discover Lang-8, I decide to try again. I think knowing that someone on the internet will read my journal and correct my mistakes would be a great incentive for me to keep on writing. I also would be very happy if I can help you to improve your Chinese. I used to be a Chinese tutor in college and I have to say that I simply enjoy tutoring. Finally, I would like to write a little bit more about myself. I'm a 24-year girl who enjoys reading the travelling. I appreciate the beauty of language and pledge to myself that I will read my favorite foreignal literatures in their original languages. I cherish friendship and I respect people who have different opinions with me. My favorate quote is Russell's three passion of life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, the unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.

I would like to write about my experience of traveling through India. I’ve been to India twice: first time in Goa for two weeks and second time in central India for three weeks. So, about my last trip I am going to write. Or rather I’ll translate my notes that I wrote down during the travel.Report one. Pushkar. 29th December.Now I am in the sacred town Pushkar. In spite of its size (the population is about 15 thousands people) this township is fairly good known in India. In the middle of the town is situated sacred lake, where pilgrims bath to pure their karma. Tourists bath as well to make some photos.This place is also famous for plenty of its temples. Local people told me that there are one thousand temples. I do not know how much true is in this fact, but there are really a lot of sacred places. The town is riddled with them and also it is said that on any tiny hill in the surroundings you can also find temple.We have settled in a very nice hotel with a good restaurant and very amusing staff. Everybody says to each other: “Hi du-u-ude!”, smoke hash and relaxing in a chill-out. Nobody hurry and everybody is happy.Five hours ago in this hotel I was deprived of my drug’s virginity. I drank milk shake with a good dose of marijuana (they call it special lassi). In five minutes my heart starts beating hardly and I was close to pass out. I was very scared and asked Oleg to go for restaurant chef, who was dubbed here as Doctor Aloon. He sat near me clapped my shoulder and said that there is nothing to scare about. He said that everything is normal, that I should relax and take a pleasure. Doctor also explained that in this condition people usually do yoga trainings, read mantra or bible. It calmed me down and I tried to relax. Almost straight away I had hallucinations. When I closed my eyes on the inner sides of eyelids as on the screen started different movies. And I was author of all this movies. I was like a genius film maker with a reach fantasy, who stores in his mighty memory thousands of forms and shapes. I was creating from these shapes new fabulous worlds. And every world was unique. And after two seconds I destroyed just created world to give life for new one.I do not know how much time I lied on a bed like a film maker but in some time movies slowly become not so bright and then disappeared at all. And I began to listen to some voices. It was like I come back to my childhood and I found myself in my old kindergarten. There were many different children voices, some screaming, clanging of tableware on the kitchen and so on.Then I slept a bit and woke up in two hours. After awake I was in normal condition and I go with Oleg to see the evening town.

hello, everyone!!! recently i've got a task to translate a text from my native language to english. well, i consider it the most difficult task and i'm definitely not good at it. i need it to sound as natural as possible. hope you'll help me^_^ there it isAfter rising for a number of years annual world military expenditure appears to have reached a peak in 1990. There are now grounds to expect expenditures to reduce with the subsequent improvements of international political climate. But today’s worldwide military expenditures still amount to more than 850 billion US dollars per year, and it is estimated as 1, 7 million US dollars per minute. More than 80% of that sum is spent on conventional weapons and armed forces. Conventional weapons make up the bulk of military expenditures even in nuclear-weapon states. On the whole developed countries are accounted for by about 80% of total military expenditures ratio around the globe.Because of the data lack worldwide military expenditures calculation is inevitably inaccurate. Moreover, there are some difficulties concerned with exchange national rates, military production system, the costing of military production (military output cost accounting) and civilian and military sector price pattern as well.  In 1980 UN General Assembly introduced a standardized reporting system to overcome this difficulty and subsequently recommended that Member states report annually to the UN Secretary General using this system. In 1988 UN Secretary General received data from 28 countries based on the reporting instrument. From 1987 on increasing political support of the effective integrated reporting system is embodied in General Assembly resolutions.

Hello,I created this text for one international forum. If you see any mistakes in my English, please correct:I am from Saint-Petersburg, Russia.I am staying in Helsinki on July 3 - July 5.I would like to meet someone who lives in Helsinki over a cup of tea and practice my (still very poor) Finnish.If you would like to, please reply to this post and I'll contact you.It also would be nice you can recommend me interesting events during my stay.I checked the groups google calendar, but it looks as if there's nothing planned during these days.I am new to group and perhaps missed something important in rules or events. If there's something wrong with my request please tell ;)

Hey! I translated the first part of a French song in English, I would be glad if you took a look at it. I'm trying to keep the same tone and mood, but the rhymes and the length of the lines do not matter.So here are the French lyrics :La toune d’automnePar Les Cowboys fringantsComment ça va, ma p’tite sœur?Viens que j’te serre dans mes bras.Pis, as-tu retrouvé le bonheur dans ton trip au Canada?J’avoue que cette année, il s’est pas passé grand-choseC’est un peu morose.J’espère au moins que c’était l’fun là-basJ’suis fier que tu m’aies pas ramené un beau frère de l’AlbertaÇa m’aurait un peu ébranlé.Jure-moi que, cette fois-là,Tu restes à maison, pour de bon.Anyway, j’suis content que tu reviennesT’arrives en même temps que l’automneT’sais que ça m’a fait bien d’la peineDe te voir partir, ma mignonneAutumn MelodyBy Les Cowboys fringantsHow are you doing, my little sister?Come here so I can *hold* you in my arms.So, *did you find* happiness back, during your journey through Canada?I have to say: nothing much happened this yearIt’s kind of morose.I hope at least you had fun out there,I’m glad you haven’t brought me back an in-law form AlbertaIt would have *shaken* me a little*Swear to me*, this time, you are staying home for good.In anyways, I’m happy that you do come backYou arrive just as autumn doesYou know it made me sadTo see you go away, my *dear(cutie??)*.The words in with *... * are the ones I am not sure of. It would be nice of you to have a particular look on these ones.Thank you.

I often heard (and said also) that French people are not good at speaking foreign languages, specially English language. Because, of course, English is the main foreign language for all non native speakers.I suppose it's true but I'd like to point out several reasons which, for me, could explain that. I recently realized, while I was learning Chinese, that English and French were very close. A lot of words are indeed the same because of the history of both languages, common roots or other reasons I don't want to develop. So, the first reflex when trying to communicate is to simply translate from French to English using similar words. Sometimes, it can be very confusing because all phrases and sentences can't match that way. And when it comes to speaking, French people are also tempted to prononce the same way they would do in their native language. Which oftens gives someting completely lame.I can mention the fact too that, as opposed to Chinese speakers whose ears are used to recognize the different tones, we French people use a flat tone language and don't even figure out that tones are also important while speaking in English.I don't want to excuse our poor language skills but just understand why this is the case !

Dear lang-8 English gurus, if you have enough time and patience, could you please make me the courtesy of checking my translation of a webpage text. Since the text is long and bound to have many mistakes I won't mind if you correct only one or two random passages (In fact, I won't particulary mind if you don't correct anything, I'll just be a bit upset).I know it is barefaced impudence to ask such a thing... But a few hours ago I was asked by a friend of mine to help her with a translation and I just can't neglect it! The deadline it tomorrow morning.Warning: It is not my fault that the text is so bla-bla-bla-like. I'm sure hardly anyone reads such stuff and the company only needs it to wind up its webpage rating and make it look (but not necessarily be) presentable. I'm terribly sorry for logical mistakes in the text! The raw version looked even worse, believe me!   I promise you my infinite gratitude!

This is text i've written in order to test my formal english. I'd really thank if you help me by correcting the bad expressions, just be careful and try not to confuse me. This is neither the real text nor the complete one. I'm writing it in fragments and modifying it, of course.------------------------------------We're usually doing different things not to think about one single topic. Can you figure someone thinking about only one theme? For sure that person is probably going crazy. But we don't have to deal hard with this, because the current time have a great arsenal of items that get us out of the actual world. But, wait, because I haven't said that that necessary has to be an advantage. Is an advantage if we look at it from the point of the practicity.Everything is easier nowadays, we have access to a lot of info that people in the past didn't have. That's probably the real essence of the inventions of men since immemorable times. However, there's something that I cannot trust yet, and it's these studies that have come out about the rate of intelligence and it says that people from the present time have a higher intelligence rate. But, what about the great scientifics from the 15th 17th 18th, and so on? are we by chance smarter than then? hell no!As far as I'm concerned, I don't find practicity good tool, since it feeds our lazyness. The people from the past didn't enjoy the Internet and maybe nice and organized libraries as we have now, it was harder for them to find anything they needed. I cannot imagine Newton searching for the Aristotle or Da Vinci's life and works, pressing, maybe, ctrl+f so that he could find the key word on "Metaphysics". That's what makes me think they, the first scientifics, deserve more merit than any others, they had to make a REAL research, book by book, page by page, experiment after experiment.

                 Should Free Music Downloads be Banned?    Some people are in favor of idea of downloading free music. They point out the fact that it can enrich our life, They also argue that free music are good for the music industry because they help increase the popularity of music.    However, other people stand on a different ground, They consider it harmful to download free music. They firmly point out that free music violate the intellectual property rights of musicians. An example can give the details of musical products such as CDs, which may do harm to the whole music industry.    There is some truth in both arguments. But I think the disadvantages of free music downloads overweigh the advantages. In addition to the above-mentioned positive effects it might bring about, Free music also may make people negative in writing music.    (There is an exam next month. This is an practice composition for it.)     请大家帮忙修改下。Thanks.

The gay marriageNowadays, People have the right to get married, it is a right for everyone but what do you think about the gay marriage?Firstly, some people same that everyone have the right to be happy and the law is the same for all. For that reason, there should not matter the sexual orientation.Besides, many experts believe that children raised by homosexual couples grow as well as children raised by heterosexual couples.However, religious people think that God only created man and woman to form a family.Also, many people say that the adoptation only be allowed to heterosexual couples because children could be confused in a gay marriage.Personally, I think the gay marriage is not a religious topic and all people have the right to get married without discrimination.

This text is my assignment at the English school.Takashi was 6th grader of elementary school in Chiba prefecture. After school, he went to the cram school which is one hour away from home every day.　The cram school is so far away that he had little time to play with his friends, but he thought the cram school was fun. Because there was a wonderful teacher he liked. This young teacher encouraged and commended him. Most importantly, the teacher gave him a dearest dream. The teacher told him, "If you study hard, you will enter the famous junior high school in Tokyo. So, he studied hard every day. One day, he said to his mother when he returned home from school, " Everyone trained for the athletic meet." He wanted to train, but he had to go to the cram school, so he didn’t. He wanted to win a prize at the athletic meet. He felt very sad. His mother asked him, “Which race do you want to take part in? He answered, “I want to take part in the 100 meter dash.” During talking about the race, his mother came up with a good idea. She said, “If you use your head, you win the race.” He asked, “What do you mean?”

Recently, there have been lots of newspaper and public figures criticizing the policies implemented by the Mexican government in order to lessen the impact of the global crisis in Mexico. The comparisons between Brazil and Mexico are inevitable: how is it possible that the Mexican economy had contracted 7% and the Brazilian only 0%? Moreover, why Mexico was the worst Latin American country dealing with the global financial crisis?First of all, let's say some facts. According to the National Institute of Statistic and Geography (INEGI), Mexican exports are heavily dependent on the USA market (75% of its exports are to the States). In Mexico, the states with the highest rates of economic growth (above 4%) are the northern ones: Baja California, South Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, Sonora, Tamaulipas and also Aguascalientes and Quintana Roo (this one in the south). The northern states, which are the ones more integrated with the USA economy, are export led economies, such as Aguascalientes and Quintana Roo, which is famous resort dependent on the US tourists.Now, taking into account that fact (that the Mexican states which are leading the economic growth in Mexico are export oriented economies with the US as the main destiny of its exports). It is not surprising that the Mexican economy had experimented that kind of economic contraction.In South America, there is no state so dependent on the US market like Mexico. The solution would be to diversify the trade, but you know that since the end of the XIX century, Porfirio Díaz, a Mexican "dictator", stated that diversifying the trade was a necessary condition in order to reduce the dependency of the Mexican economy in relation to the United States economy.If it happened that the Mexican economy would increase it's net output following an export oriented solution, it would be through an increase in exports to the USA. There are trade models based in the fact that bigger economies tend to "attract" the exports from the nearer countries. Unless Mexico managed to create goods which are not demanded from citizens in the United States -or strengthen its internal market-, Mexico won't be able to avoid the effects of the US crises.

She had recruted six young skills and their submitted an intensive entrainment of singing, dancing, theater,... diffused on a TV documentary. one of their was eliminated because judged so shy by the production. So Big Bang have five members with their own speciality.	Rapper, singer, producer, composer, G-Dragon have just 22 years old but he’s the leader of the band. He’s in the YGFamily since 2000. He prefer rapping in english.	It’s T.O.P who rap in korean. He is the alone beatboxer, ie he can producing rhythm and musical sounds using one's mouth, lips, tongue and voice.

Seung Ri is the youngest in the band and he got noticed for his talents as a dancer.Haru haru : This video clip has been realized in 2009. It is based on a scenario and then asks for a game that each player was shown playing in series or drama. It begins by a confrontation between G-Dragon and T.O.P about a girlfriend but she had a medical problem. then the two boys join in grief. the three other members are secondary characters. T.O.P is infact only the best friend of the girl and he must gave her ring to G-Dragon if she were to die. The artists faced with anger and sadness.Gara Gara Go : Dated to 2009, this song highlight their hip hop dance skills. much of theirs choregraphies are known and disseminated through tutorials on internet for example. we understand why Koreans are hip-hop champions of the world!Lollipop :More to be singers, dancers and actors, the Big Bang’s members are fashion icons. You can buy the cap of G-Dragon or the mask of T.O.P. Theirs clothings are often colored, as we can see in the video clip of Lollipop. It promote the new phone of the korean company LG. In fact, there are two versions. In the first, this artists are featured with the korean girl band produced by G-Dragon 2NE1. In the second, the phone is really shown.

Today is the first day of the tiger year.We should have a happy mood.Because it means a new beginning and get rid of the past.But it snowed heavily last night .When I got up at about 11:00,I found the whole world had turned in white again.The temperature was so low,so that I wore many clothes.    Today's date is February 14th 2010.It is also the Valentine's Day of western.But it seems has nothing to do with me.Bacause I had parted with my boyfriend.Since now,he had been the one who loves me most.But we must leave each other because of something.Everyday I miss him,but I cannot tell him,only to write in diary.I wish he could find a girl who is better than me and lead a ideal life in the future.   I know I shouldn't,but I really feel a litter sad now.When something is lost,it may never be found back again.Such as love,time,affection and so on.We should value everything we have now.When it lost,it may too late to regret.

          This is  an aged  saying ,but the truth in it is universal;we can do everything no matter how complex it is as long as we spare no efforts to do it.No one can deny it,for it is self-evident.          The ancients realized this in the early time and the saying has passed on with time going by,while in this present-day society ,numerous people still turn a dear ear to it.On the  one hand,they are keen on  being surrounded with successful glory;on the other hand,they are reluctant to take practical action.Worse still,they are always complaining about the bad fortune or the difficulty  of the task instead of their insufficient work when they fail to make it .They owe other's success to good fortune ,which is rather rediculous.They do neglect the fact that diligence is the mother of good fortune and success is no accident.         No man is born wise or learned ,it is the hard work that makes it possible for man to be what he wants to be .And nothing in the world is difficult for one who sets his mind to it.Let's take Stephen Hawking for example.Be diagnosed with an incurable disease and may not have more than twelve months to live,Hawking went on with his research and continued pursuing his dream through thick and thin instead of   giving up .Disease though has disabled him ,his efforts kept him moving .Seated in  a wheelchair and speaking  through a computer can not discourage Hawking ,for no way is impossible to courage.As expected,pleasure comes through toil,Hawking naturally reached his goal at last. His discoveries about the Big Bang and black holes contributed greatly to the scientific research,and his work A Brief History Of Time proved  to be a best-seller.Globly fameous  as he was,no one knows exactly how much he paid for his success.            Thus,I dare say ,no pains ,no gains.Nothing is difficult  to the man who will try, and Hawking sets a typical example  for us .There is no point in complaing about the fortune or the task itself,it is absolutely only a waste of time .AS the saying goes,better to light one candle than to curse the darkness.So don't hesitate to take effective action and never say die once you make your mind to  do something,just for the fact that nothing in the world is difficult to the man who will try !

According to the program....Before this economic crisis began last September, a lot of worker had come to London from another EU country (for example, Pohland). When there was a rush of construction work during the period of prosperity, you could see many foreigners working at such sites. However, UK as well as another country suffers a shakeout now, threfore it is very difficult for these foreigner to have a job. Most of them have already returned and those who still stay in London are also anxious for whether they secure their job or not....Lang-8 friend, if you read my diary, please tell me current status.

A sense of loneliness encouraged me to take a train and go to rural areas. To purge myself of stressful works, I walked along the river and jotted down a diary, recalling the past days. I find I get increasingly attached to things of the past. All the time I attempt to put the future and goals before the things that have gone, not to be stuck in the history. However, I found men have their own traits that never chane. That's why I repeat the same behaviors and thoughts.

Hi, there.This is the first time I write my journal here in Lang-8. I love writing my journal in English because I am able to organize my ideas while writing and also because I want my journal to be read as many people aspossible with a proper feedback or comment from natives. Through this process, my writing ability will be getting better and better, I believe.I hope to work globally in the future in the financial industry, which is now in big trouble, though. This is because I want to be familiar with finance, which is considered one of the most important literacies from now on both an individual and corporate point of view. In order for my dream to come true, I am currently preparing for studying in the U.S., majoring in finance. Some people working globally often say in his orher books that one should have strong skills which help the person survive a professional field. "Get out of comfortable zone" is my motto this year. I really know the fact that just a little more effort is important for us to seek a change toour life and then just continue what you believe makes a difference. I want to make friends with anyone who owns concrete mindsets."Opportunities are for those who are well-prepared."See you later

The dream begins when I was coming back from Bariloche (an excellent place for tourism), and it seemed that a big company of games development took over the world. They assigned the level -1 to every person. To be level 0 (in order to start to “play”), you should touch someone, whoever, only touch him/her... and I don’t know why the hell I wanted to be the only “normal” person, i.e. keep my level in -1. And don’t ask me why, but when people saw me they began to haunt me, just like a zombie game (check out Left 4 Dead for further information).I also remember reading the web news via PC and SMS. OK. I was on the streets and started to run. I went to my school, where I started to hit anyone who wanted to touch me, and I also remember killing some friends, more than once, and strangely they’re all always playing CS, so I could deduce they were respawning.After that I went to the kindergarten zone, where I hid under a bed. At that point, also the “president” of this “enterprise” were looking for me, because it seemed that I was the last person with the -1 level. Then, a girl that I barely know, deduced that I was under the bed (this was simplified, she actually said something like “well, the guitar is above de wardrobe, and they always ‘save’ the bass under the bed so he should be there”). Then I got up and I started laughing (like Light Yagami when the detectives team discover he’s Kira), and I said, it’s true, that’s me. The president didn’t believe in my words so I started to run again. When I got out the school I entered into a dark forest, pretty simmilar to the Forbidden Forest). I kept running and I entered to my grandma’s house, where –I don’t know why- I needed to jump a wall like a ninja, and the neighbors were waiting me in the other side, and hell, I started to run again. I appeared in a known avenue, I kept running for a few blocks and I saw my mom calling me from far away. When I approached she told me that a neighbor died or something, I didn’t pay much attention, but I greeted her, so hello, level 0.After that, via SMS, they advised me that I should destroy a building (or a castle) with a single kick in order to be level 1. I don’t know how I made it and from now on I didn’t remember so much, only that when I became level 2, I grow up a lot (actually I was a gigant in my opinion), and I also remember that a gigant armor (pretty simmilar to the Saint Seiya’s Gold Armors) fell directly to my body, and I heard a guy that was on my left asking “what’s this shit?”, and when I saw him he was dressed like a Digimon.

THE DECISION - Part one.By Dedalo.He had never been there before until that day. It was the day when everything happened. He was there looking out of the window, everything was quiet; he could not hear the noise on the street, but just the silence in his room. He looked for this special room away from all that annoying noise. Beautiful silence, all thatHe needed, just peace, peace in his mind.He needed time to think, Just a couple of hours to clear his mind, there's always a struggle in the life of a man when he must decide between what's fair and what's right, and the fair or right choice is not always obvious;  so this was the right moment to look inside himself, to look into the depths of his heart,  and then wonder, what must  I do?. His mistake is the misery of someone else,   but there's not much time,  opportunities come only once and never come back again, they are like a wind that touches your face just once, the next current of wind is always different from the first one.

Yesterday I was driving on the center-divided road. The road was slightly curved. I couldn't see well a car coming toward me. I sensed the car seem a little closer as an oncoming car. Then I noticed the car running on the exact same lane as mine. I stepped on a blake and stopped. The other car was in front of me. The driver, an Asian male, was smiling apologetically, still driving to the opposite direction. All the cars on the same side of mine stopped, appalled. I avoided the car leaving the mess behind me.  I have no idea why it happened. But as you know, in Japan, cars run on the left side. Maybe he is a Japanese newly here, and entered the wrong lane when he turned at the intersection. Anyway that was a scary moment. I reminded myself that I should be alerted all the time when I'm driving.

It is the first time I'm writing here, so I’m a bit nervous. I learn English mostly by myself. We study it at school, but our teacher usually corrects only the grossest mistakes and pays absolutely no attention to pronunciation. And as we have only two English lessons per week, it’s impossible to know language any good. So I can say that it were two wonderful writers, Oscar Wilde and Stephen Fry, who taught me English. Sounds really pompous, doesn’t it? :) But it is true. These are two men who made me really interested in English, who made me realize how beautiful this language can be.The story of falling in love with another language I learn, German, is much simpler. I heard people speaking it and that exact moment I realized that I loved it and wanted to learn it. I’ve been learning it for two years now, it’s much harder than English for me, I don’t really get how adjectives change depending on cases and my vocabulary is just ridiculous. But then I imagine how hard it is for foreigners to learn my native language, Russian, and realize that moaning about German grammar is just pathetic. So I keep going.I would write about my love to Arabic language, that I started learning less than a year ago, but then this entry would be too long to check (and to read, as you must be already really bored with this nonsense).Thank you for reading.P.S. Would you be so kind to check my punctuation too? I put commas almost as if I’m writing in Russian and that’s quite a lot, I think.

The issue whether people should choose a job with a high salary or more vacation time is a topic that is often discussed and there are differing opinions about this issue. Some prefer to have a high salary, because they could buy some things that they like most, while others would choose a job with more vacation time for enjoying themselves. In my view, I prefer to have a job with more vacation time instead of a high salary for several reasons.Admittedly, earning money is one of the aims of our work. No one could deny the fact that money could not only maintain our daily lives but also could help us to achieve some of our personal goals, such as buying a car, living in a big house or helping those who live in poverty or starvation. Making money will enable us to improve our living environment and quality, and therefore getting a job with a high salary, is significant to us. However, others go into rapture at mere notion of getting money, however having a job with a high salary, is less useful than many people believe. People, who are addicted to a high income, have to spend more time working or staying in the office, and as a result, it is impossible for them to devote enough time and energy in communicating with family members. Moreover, it is difficult to develop and cultivate their children’s character and interpersonal skills and they may become more solitary and even suffer from certain emotional or psychological problems. Therefore, it is undesirable to hanker for a high salary instead of staying with family members. Furthermore, the majority of people believe that having more vacation time will provide them additional opportunities to broaden their horizons, which may put them in a favorable position prove their situation. As we know, traveling can allow us to actually meet different cultures, which we could not get from textbooks or classrooms. As an architect, although he could learn about masterpieces from the internet and magazines, the feeling of touch of the actual buildings, such as the Sydney Opera house, is totally different， We could find abundant information about the plans, sections and elevations, but we could not recognize the size, the space or the material. Having vacation time and traveling could provide us with an opportunity to realize the dream and therefore almost all of us benefit from vacation time.Therefore, I am firmly convinced that having a job with more vacation time, will bring about a profound impact on families, the person himself and even the society as whole.

Mrs Stone had spent the whole morning cooking. It was nearly lunch time, so she decided to pick some blackberries to accompany the pudding she had prepared. She was just picking a fruit when she heard a noise in the bushes. Then she saw an animal which looked like a large cat. She knew it was not a cat because it was too large. The animal suddenly jumped and she thought it was going to attack her. She dropped her basket and shouted terrified. Hearing the sound, the animal ran away, after which, Mrs Stone picked her basket and ran all the way home. She told her neighbours that she had seen a puma but they didn't believe her. She also telephoned the police but they thought she was joking or perhaps she was a crazy woman who had had a hallucination.

I always have wanted to know to my maternal grandfather. Only I have some paintings his. He must have been a great painter, besides of a great father. My mom told me about him, she said me that my grand father must have loved to me, but when I was a little baby my grandfather died of heart attack. In this moment think that he may be live. He might have smoked a little less; this could have made the difference. Doesn´t matter now, may be nevertheless that his dead being a legacy of life for my. In spite of all, we must have had a very good relationship. He might have learned to me to paint beautiful paintings as he, while both take a cup of coffee together. I must imagine that my grandfather had a lot of patience for painting and therefore might have patient for to teach me. I like me drawing, may be because to my grandfather too like made it. His paintings are relaxing and deep. To my brother Oswaldo too like his paintings and he (my brother) may have learned with me to draw, he must be agree. Besides, my grandfather too was a good cook. He could prepare a lot of delicious meals. He taught to my mom and uncles to cook food of much places from Mexico, then my grandfather was young he was a cook in the marine forces, there may have learned different meals throughout the years and miles around the country. Curiously to me too like to cook, even tough I´m not so good, but I think that when my mother prepare a meal or food for me and for my brothers, my grandfather maybe present with us. Finally I could think that my grandfather continue living in his paintings and the meals that tough to prepare to my mom and uncles. He must feel proud of this, and I admire his life.

Thank you for reading this! I am in preparation process to IELTS examination and looking for your assistance with English. This is the random topic I just received:Some people believe that modern games played by children do not develop a wide range of skills. Traditional games, however, develop different skills in children. To what extent do you agree? And now look at my essey:Games are undoubtfully important for health and phisical skills of children. But unfortunatelly today we can see that our favorite yard games are not so popular between kids. They prefer computers and videogames rather then fresh air activities. My choice is obvious - children should play real games! I am not athletic fanat, but at least they have to feel qurious and to be interested in school-yard games, they need to run, to jump and so on. Computer games are acceptable just in case of bad weather. Fresh air games develop phisical skills, make chuldren stronger, faster and improve their health. Sitting hour by hour at the same position and keep an eye on the screen harm young kids health. Therefore, I completely agree with idea that traditional games develop skills much better then modern games.

My English teacher is a middle-age woman who can speak 3 languages - French, Russian and English. And there are 6 classmates in my class. At the beginning of this term, I would like to go there for a conversation course, but they arranged me to learn in another course concentrating on grammars.My teacher is great. My classmates are great too. I made some friends there. One thing makes me crazy is that all of them can speak French except me.

I just deleted all the stuff I had written, I´ve decided to write an actual personal journal. Now, I´m gonna do it in English because, after all English is my second language and the whole point of this web page is be ¨language helped¨ so, I´m sure there will be plenty of stuff for me to improve on, heck lord knows that would probably be the case even if I were to write this in spanish.Anyways,  So I´ll get started. I´m currently 25 years old, and at this point in my life, I have come to realize that most of the stuff I´ve done so far, has happened because I thought I was supposed to do it, and it´s not that I regreat anything, but now I understand why I felt confused and lost after graduating from the university. After getting my degree, I didn´t automaticaly get a job, in fact I spent several months doing almost nothing (well I´m kinda always working as a freelance illustrator but that´s really just a hobbie), and that kinda depressed me, I felt like such a loser, but I didn´t know what to do, I didn´t want to just get a job, what about my ¨dreams¨ what about the stuff that was supposed to happen, you know, we all go through this at some point, and people tell jokes about it all the time, but damn!, that still dont make it any easier to accept, does it?.Last year I found a job oportunity as a videogame designer, I did many tests and actually got the job, I felt so happy because I thought I would be doing something close to my dream (after all I HAD studied to be a designer) and to be honest, it felt good to have won the job over many other aplicants. Unfortunately as months went by, I lost hope on the company, most of their videogames were copy versions of other famous games, and after talking to many coworkers, I realized they would never let me make an original game, they even scolded me once for not copying other games. So since I wasn´t making that much money anyways, I just quit, I mean after all, I wasn´t even working for them directly, but through another company that specializes in hiring people. I would´ve ¨lived¨ in that studio for something I believed in, and I almost did some times, but then... well... I already wrote that.So yeah, right now, I´m fighting to do what I really feel like doing... I always wanted to learn japanese? never did cuz I was led to believe it was too damn hard and there was no point to it since I already spoke english anyways; fuck it I´m learning japanese, I never learned to play the guitar as a teenager; fuck it Im learning to play the guitar; I need to get a job? I´ll teach  english... I´m not good enough? I´m not really a teacher yet?, fuck it I´ll learn that too.I never really did a journal; thought it was pointless; who would care about this stuff; fuck it I´m writing it for myself.This generation... my generation, doesn´t really seem to know what they want, you grow up watching TV, playing videogames and daydreaming, but sooner or later you have to wake up. I try not to whine but, this is kinda what I see around me and sometimes still see in myself... I don´t think it ever goes away, I believe now that we ought to be always looking for our own paths to walk, to make our own lives the adventure we want to live, and just knowing that is exciting already.

Hi, nice to meet you!I'm a korean student. I'm studying about English, and Chinese.This is a my first composition(sentence? text? which is more proper?).It seems that this site is very useful to learn many languages.I think it's very interesting that sentences I wrote are seen and rewritten correctly.If people, include I, who have trouble learning languages find this site, it's very helpful to them.Today I learned that in English, 'and, but, or, so, for' are cannot be disposed on head of sentence.However I saw many sentences which these conjunctions are disposed on head.Then, saying strictly, those sentences are ungrammatical?

I renewed my driver's license yesterday.Before going to the plice office,I applied makeup carefully and put on a necklace and pierced earrings because I would take an identification photo for driver's license there.But the staff said "Look at the lens of the camera please."then took my picture as soon as I sat on the chair.The picture doesn't satisfy me.The pierced earrings got behind my hair.The head of the necklace was out of the photo edge.My eyes don't smile as I imagined.But anyway,It was good I could renew it without any difficulties.昨日、運転免許証の更新をしてきました。警察署に行く前に、入念に化粧をして、ネックレスとピアスをつけました。そこで、運転免許証用の証明写真を撮るからです。でも、係員の人は、私が椅子に座るやいなや「レンズを見て下さい。」と言ってシャッターを押しました。その写真は気に入りません。ピアスは髪の後ろに隠れてしまいました。ネックレスのヘッドは写真の枠外になってしまいました。予想していたほど、目が笑っていません。でも、とにかく無事に免許が更新できて良かったです。

I've not written for a while....(^^;) haha...This time, let me talk about my 3 consecutive holidays. We went out to see a sight colored the leaves by car. The place is most beautiful this season. However, we were stuck up...Many visitors were also heading for the place. (They seemed to have the same plan. lol) The cars didn't move at all! What's worse, these were strung for kilometers behind and forward. Not wanting to waste our time, we changed the plan. We visited a huge park where there is playground equipment. It was a little cold; nevertheless, many families were playing there. :D Needless to say, our son was also excited and his eyes were bright. lolThe next day, I decided to rent a few DVDs and CDs because my husband had to work...After going for a walk, we dropped at a rental shop. I chose "Enchanted". and some CDs of the Christmas songs for kids. The movie is one of Disney films, so it wasn't hard to catch the lines and to understand the story. My son also enjoyed watching. ;DThe last of the holidays was raining...Although I was supposed to stay at home, my husband wanted to go out and talked me into visiting somewhere....Eventually, he won..lolAs we've been carried out drastic reforms for our household expenses like the government and the supplementary budget of our family isn't approved, we can't spend much money. hahahaBut, we went to a big mall because we wanted to check Christmas present for our son. Although it was just window-shopping, as such we enjoyed. lol

Tomorrow, one of our last actions for Japan will be organise, and I hope every persons who are suppose to help us will come. Since the march's earthquake, all the students in japanese of our school rallied to find funds for the Japanese Red Cross. And I'm very proud we managed to gather about 700 € in 3 weeks.Of course, as a student in japanese, I have participated to the collect. But I found it wasn't enough just to only do something in our school. So, the idea of a charitable forum reachable for everyone in our town grew up in our minds. It is very complicated to organise, and even if I have my exams soon, I really want to participate, it's really important for me. So, tomorrow we are supposed to meet us to share the tasks out. During that forum that we want to organise, we will propose japanese and origami lessons, and also maybe a calligraphy's workshop. For these lessons, we'll ask in exchange as money as people want to give us, then we'll send all to the Japanese Red Cross. I hope it will work and be useful, wholeheartedly.Mukeii.

During people's life, it is no doubt that they meet various problems. People have to spend lots of time to solve these problems. People's solutions may vary as different people may have different ideas. However, in my opinion, understanding the past is a good way to solve the problems present and future, as it can improve the sufficiency of solving problems， give us lots of valuable solutions and even avoid these problems. To begin with, understanding the past can increase the speed of solving problems. As we all know, there are some principles in our society, just as the regulation of evolvement that exists in nature. Events may occur, develop and disappear according to some principles and have its own internal regulations. As a result, we can predict what will be happened about the problem in the future according to understanding the past. And with the past experience, we can predict immediately that some solutions will not work positively, so we do not need to waste time to try these solutions. We only need to take actions to use some valuable solutions. In this way, problems can be solved with higher sufficiency. Moreover, understanding the past can offer people many valuable solutions. And people can use these to solve problems present and future. As the development of the society has its own regulation and people can catch it through understanding the past. So solutions about some similar problems are still useful in modern society. When people can not come up with good solutions for a long time and they do not actually know what to do next, they'd better to check the history and find some similar problems that existed in the past. Think about solutions of these problems, then people may have a new thinking about the problem. They may also have a better solution considering the solutions in the past. Thus understanding the past can give people more good solutions to the problem present and future. In addition, understanding the past can even teach people how to avoid problems present and in the future. As I have written, the society develops with its principle and some events and things may repeat at interval. Therefore, if people can understand the causes, the beginning of the problem, they can take actions immediately to avoid the problem when there are some clues that demonstrate that some problems may happen next. Fortunately, people can save lots of time and energy comparing to solving problems after they have happened. There is a traditional Chinese saying that understanding the past can know the present and future better. To solve the problems present and future is it necessary to understand the past.

At the beginning of the short humorous story “News for a peeper”, written by Peter Langdale,  we meet the main character, a curious newly married woman Stella. Bill and Emily are married for only three months, but they already have to face with usual problems of incompatibility and bad temper of each other. Emily, having no experience in relationship, sees that her husband pays less and less attention to her. She is already fed up with his temperament and lack of sense of gratitude. Being curious what Bill is going to do if she deserts him, one day Emily lets her imagination and impulses control her and leaves. She writes a farewell note and puts it on the dressing table. Just for appearance she packs few suitcases with clothes and goes out with a strong intention to never come back untill her husband Bill feels guilty and begs her back. But the lure of missing his reaction eats her up. And then another, more terrible thought comes into her mind: after reading the note her husband may take to drinking or even kill himself! On reflection of preventing the disaster she comes back. Her curiosity triumphs over her sanity and she lurks under the bed, the most appropriate place for peeping without being noticed. Of course, she is certain that her husband barely can discover her naïve plan.  Bill comes home. After reading the note he puts it away into his pocket, and the things unexpectedly goes in a completely different way: instead of loosing his head, he takes out his best suit and puts it on. Displaying his great mood, he begins to hum a joyful melody. Such behaviour throws Emily for a loop – he scarcely seems repentant. He writes something on the note, puts it back to the dressing table and leaves. This note must illuminate Bill’s unforeseen actions. Puzzled, Stella crawls out and reads: “It’s much softer ON the bed”. It is apparent that Bill has disclosed the entire plan after reading the note. Certainly she, hiding under the bed, anticipates quite different reaction. He is a judicious man with a big deal of sense of humour, and that’s why he, propeled by desire to mock at her, seats hevily on the bed in order to hold Emily up to ridicule, clearly demonstrates his changing mood. On the other hand, his respond may let us guess that he loves her much, but doesn’t want to be controlled and gives her a lesson.Summing up, I find this short story interesting, indeed humorous. Its plot changes unexpectedly and it was really amusing to read it. The author gives us a good, vivid example of life of newly married coples and their problems, accentuates on one of the most widespread mistakes of young women – desire to control each action of their husbands.

But later I didn't know why he treated us with unfair. One client had come to our showroom before, the manager and I entertained the client, but in the end, my colleague handled the following work. Except that the manager ask my colleague to do almost the whole thing, and we didn't even speak more that 5 sentences in a day. I could not intolerable that they talked the work between me and ignore me, as I sit between them. I think a manager will care about the team work, but not create the trouble between the colleagues. I don't think he is a good manager, he came to company just without one month, and I am sure I don't make anything wrong, I am just a freshman in this career, a manager can't tolerate a freshman, if he a good handler? I don't want to face with the people any more.

It irritates me, but I can`t do nothing with it.I do like some new experiences in my life, so I went in the English speaker`s club for the first time, to hear my friends speach. There were lots of people and I was scared that someone will want me to make a self presentation, but it didn`t happened. Than, after this, I drank vine with my friends and, also, we were watching the film"Wristcutters". It`s nice, but ... well.. I do such things every day. Something new, what doesn`t look so, than the same. That`s the problem, but it`s ok.Now I`m studying English and French, I hope to be a translator, not an enterpreter, you know, I do not like this, but the written translation it`s the thing I`ll like I guess.

Now a festival of my university is being held, and my club is joining it by offering a target practice game using bows and arrows of archery.I'm a manager of the attraction, so I have worked to make it succeed.I found it puzzled to manage a event or a program efficiently without generating a free rider.The event is not free, so we earn a lot of money. The money we earn is distributed to the team members, who work as a reception or a clerk. Whether earning money or not is an important point, for a manner of a worker can change by it.Most of members of the team have done well, but some of them make problems, and make me frustrated.The worst thing that make me angry was that one of my colleages tore and throw away a paper on which I wrote what to do in the event. He might have done it as a joke, but I couldn't help feel extremely bad. I felt my effort treated as a trash, too.Feeling so, I understood that a manager must not be emotional on such a situation. I should calm down, always make my mind cool to make the best decision. How can I face to an emotional frustration? I am not  a Buddha but a human, so I cannot help being irritated when something bad happens. I have tried some ways to refrain this feeling: breathe deeply, imagine "I am a robot and I don't feel anything," or escape to the fantasic world by reading a novel of Galcia Marquez. But I think I should supress a bad feeling as soon as possible.Does anyone know the way? I want to be more optimistic.p.s. At the same time I thank to this situation, for I cannot learn how to manage "real" people by reading textbooks or attending to lectures of the university. I understand the theoretical answer, but it is far from being enough yet.I'm sorry that I wrote a gloomy, depressing  journal. I think this diary will depress a reader as much as an article written about a falling economy.

Between 2000 and 2007, the number of death, especially among children, droped from 750.000 to 190.000 a year all over the world, according to the calculation of WHO.Those figures were published in the WHO weekly epidemiological record ( 5th December ) and the weekly CDC Morbidity and mortality weekly report. The encouraging result is due to the vigorous action of the founder parters of the Initiative against measles : American red cross, Center for Disease Control and Prevention of United States ( CDC ), the UN fondation, UNICEF and WHO.In the WHO's releas, the president of american red cross board, Bonnie McElween-Hunter, highlighted that " the credit of this success is deserved to the thousand of heath workers volonteers of the Red Cross and Red Crescent organization who had taken the time to be informed, to raise awarness and motivate the mothers and the family circles to the critical importance of the children vaccination.

When you are in school, you will not surprise to find that boys always tend to favor science while girls choose liberal arts. Thus a kind of interesting phenomena is engendered. We often call science classes the monks' classes, for there are so many boys that girls become "rare species"; and arts classes are called the nuns' classes for the similar reason. Taking it for granted already, we seldom think why it happens. Are we born to be like this; or do we develop it postnatally?It is the common sense that our brains divide into two parts: the left and the right. According to a science report, the left brain is the brain of language, which means rational and logical; the right brain is the brain of image, which means emotional and intuitive. Most of the men use the left brain much more frequently than the right, hence they have the advantages over abstract thoughts, such as science and analysis. To women, the left and the right brain can be worked together that makes them do well in handcraft, social intercourse, language expressing, etc. Therefore, it is no more difficult to explain the phenomenon. If you want to question that boys can also be good at liberal arts and girls at science, I will not deny it. Of course everything has exception. However, the difference between men and women exists in general.With the development of liberty and democracy, the social structure has gradually changed. Women get more and more deserved right through incessant struggles. They begin to ask for being treated as equally as men. So this phenomenon has profound influence on the society nowadays. Instead of men for work and women for housework, women are emerging in every field of work. Especially in the fields of language, service, education and so on, which demand high quality of patience, carefulness and the power of expression, women have already taken a great part even the lead in them. On the contrary, we still see little women working in the fields of science and technology. It is the new trend that men and women will shoulder a half of the society. For that reason, the social policies must be reformed to better adapt this change. Maternity leave is one of the typical cases.    Speaking of the differences between men and women, I have interviewed some students in our campus. And we shared a variety of opinions. They say that men deal with matter more sensibly while women often act impetuously. In love affairs, men might pay more attention to the aspect of sex than women. If men are compared to living in realistic world, women may believe in romanticism and idealism. All in all, behavior difference is based on physiological difference. How men and women using brains contributes to their distinct future.

I recently moved to the new place, which is....next door!!Because the house has extra huge two windows, the room is so bright! Since the moving house is so painful and stressful in Japan, at first, I was unwilling to move to the next door, and Internet says "You might have to pay key money again. Some landlord is reluctant to allow you to move the next door."..... But, finally I called landlord and I got the next door's key in one hour, and didn't have to pay anything! How easy was that! Now, I am so happy, If you want to move to a different room in the same flat, you should ask landlord anyway. They might let you move easily!

My father started to work in this hospital in 1976. Hospitals arent a nice place, but I have good memories with this one.When I was a child, the hospital was a places full of people and life, with lovely gardens everywhere. I didnt feel scary in it maybe because it doesnt look like a hospital. There used to be militars in it but when then the hospital started to be part of the spanish health sistem (instead of being a military place) and now there's no one left. Its an empty sad place.This hospital is now death, because of a bad administration, with lots of machines and materials going to waste when we need more hospitals in Spain. I only can wait and hope that someone really takes care of this stituation to rehab this extraordinary place that counts with 87.500 m2 of extension and 22 buildings, it used to have to his own church.

Hi there, I have written this essay and since it´s the first time I do, I would like to know if you could kindly check its structure.“English has become the international language for theTourism industry: the role of translators and interpreters”During the recent years English has became the language of tourism, and since such activity has experienced a worldwide expansion, there has been an increase on the demand for professionals who can provide accurate equivalent sentences from languages deferring from English, in order to let more non-English speaking countries enter into this expanding industry.  Therefore, the role of translators and interpreters is extremely important as professionals who can provide that required service without mistakes leading to misunderstandingsSince an original sentence in a language may not have a literal meaning on English. This is what happens for example with instruction signs originally written in Japanese, where you must put “please” on every imperative sentence, and that pattern is not a must  for English imperative. This English grammar feature is known only by trained professionals, and the same happens with the need of “please” in Japanese imperative sentences; such knowledge is given under training to translators and interpreters who can put together peculiar aspects of two or more languages in order to provide coherent messages, and not sentences in English such as ““PLEASE NO SMOKE IN HERE”, where the natural sentence would be “NO SMOKING”If a sentence hasn´t been translated properly into English, visitors could experience lots of trouble, and visitors expiring trouble, are unhappy visitors. This happens for example when a sentence translated from Japanese into English gave this result: “YOU ARE INVITED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CHAMBERMAID”. Very hilarious, but actually in Japanese that is the way for saying, “SHOULD YOU NEED SOMETHING, PLEASE TELL US”, hence once again the need for people who can properly give the original idea from Japanese in English without giving chance to misunderstandings.Accurately translated sentences will bring ease of communication with your costumers, and of course, it will mean a lot of saved time explaining what was originally intended.  Again, mistranslated sentences will help us, this example was taken from a Japanese to English translation “COOLS AND HEATS: IF YOU WANT JUST CONDITION OF WARM IN YOUR ROOM, PLEASE CONTROL YOURSELF”. Customers may experience distress and may even feel insulted just because the pattern was literally translated from Japanese, a language on which the pattern “By yourself” is correspondent to a single element “Jibun”. There is no need to say that if the translation operation had been done by trained professionals, all that hilarious trouble could have been avoided.Therefore, translators and interpreters play an important role in tourism translation because they are the only professionals capable of sending one idea to English without jeopardizing understanding by literality,  without causing more problems than solutions by mistranslations to customers, and finally because they are trained to provide ease of communication when conveying ideas.

There is discussion. I'd like to learn Hebrew, but can't to install Hebrew letters on my computer because it would make problems for the other user on the comp. If I shell write Hebrew by Latin characters its would be...Write, please, the opinion of my dear reviewer, whom I am very grateful and whose English is much better then mine:The main reason why not is that it's harder for us, the native speakers, to read our language transliterated into latin characters. Instead of reading it fluently, we have to sound each word out in our mind to understand what you write. Furthermore, transliteration differences abound. And it's also not natural for us to write corrections in transliteration.Of course I can't speak for the rest of the native speakers here. There may be some native speakers who feel differently.

Wow!! I’m really excited! This weekend I went, with my wife and my two kids (they’re 19 months twins), to my parents-in-law’s second home in the countryside (it’s two hours driving from Barcelona). The idea was to be able to have a bit of rest (you know, grandparents help with the children) and also to work a little. So I brought my laptop but.... Oh no! In the rush preparing things to leave, I forgot my pendrive with all my work in my desktop!!! So what did I do? Well, fortunately I had the book I’m reading at present, and also my iPhone with the audiobook version: Deception Point, by Dan Brown.Oh my god, I can’t remember reading/listening so much in just two days!!!Friday afternoon, when we left Barcelona, I was in page 154. Sunday night, when we came back home, I was in the page 340. So almost 200 pages read in English and also almost 8 hours of audiobook listening!! I’m really happy!!!

So I try to turn myself into a brave girl.Still I hope there is somebody will see this and make friends with me.      Talking to my interests,I prefer Chinese poetries , English songs,eating things and so is hiking.Once I had a unpratical dream which is travel around the world.And the turely purpose is that I just eager to eat different kinds of food!You can imagine how important is the food to me.But today,I think that I was naive and I was a dreamer.      I  hope you guys can contact me and help me.You can recommend me somebooks that you like or help me with my English.And I am ready for listening to you about your Chinese learning problems.It's also welcomed if you just want to chat with me.      Looking forward to your response.

Two different experiences in my life    With the progress of my growth, I lived in two main places, the countryside and the city. According to my observation in my memory, I noticed there were large differences between them.    Before my senior school period, I mainly lived in my hometown, a beautiful, quiet, small village, where the sky is always blue and the air is always fresh, no matter what season it is. For example, in spring, trees, flowers, grass, and even many kinds of animals begin to come to life. In common sense, it is trees that reflect the arrival of the spring firstly. They, sprouting, tell people that the spring is just around the corner. In summer, there will be a lot rain after which the frogs chirp loudly. In autumn, the crops will be ripe and the plants will be withered. So it is often said that the autumn’s coming will be known to all when one leaf falls. In winter, almost everything sleeps and will be covered by snows. At the time, all over the world is white from earth to sky. It is so clean that you can’t help going out of the house to appreciate the beauty of the nature. Above all, the villages are kind-hearted, simple, and unadorned.     However, just from my senior school period, I had to go out of my hometown and went downtown to attend school. On arriving to the city, I find there are more high buildings, more cars and broader roads, also many beautiful parks. However, no long later, I realize that there seems to be many disadvantages in the city, such as the noise from the factories and busy roads, the environment pollution, etc. More cars lead to more traffic problems. You have to spend more time to go to a place because of the heavy traffic. More seriously, more cars means more traffic accidents, more persons will lose their lives all by sudden. On the other hand, there are much more persons living in the city in terms of the countryside. Generally, more people bring about more pollution--- more garbage and waste water from people’s daily life.  Not only will it destroy the environment, but also it will take a lot of money to deal with them. There is few trees and less move of air, leading to the low quality air. Also, the noise can make people uncomfortable.     However, despite all above, there are many advantages. It has a higher living level, and more choices are supplied on goods or jobs. More importantly, there are many of high schools and universities where you can gain precious knowledge and valuable experience.     The two different experiences are both important for me, not only at the certain time, but in all my life. Neither of them will disappear from my memory and both of them will be precious experience, because each of them means a lot to me, not only is just a place where I have lived in.

Hi! I am a student, and I attend addition English courses. I am good in English to Russian translation. There is a big trouble for me - translate Russian texts into English. Help me, please, check my homework, and explain my mistakes."You can tell about art only by showing art. This occurrence happened in the life of the famous Russian opera singer Feodor Ivanovich Chaliapin (1873 - 1938). A few actors debate about the question, what is art. Chaliapin quietly went to another room. Suddenly the door opened, he stood on the threshold of mortally pale, with disheveled hair, trembling lips, with eyes full of horror and said: "Fire!". There are panic, someone was screaming ... But Chaliapin suddenly burst out laughing: "Now do you understand what art is?!" The artists had no doubt on fire started when they saw emotional shock expression on the Chaliapin’s face, which appears on the face of the participant of an emergency, on their experience."It's a quotation from one book. I have been translated it from Russian into English.

*Hi everyone, this is the first part of my cover letter in english to successfully find a new job here in japan!! thank you very much!!* "Giving everything to find solutions" - From my work in a consulting company, I learned that, instead of waiting for an answer that won’t come, I should always adopt a positive attitude when facing a problem or an incertitude. I won’t give up before I try all the possibilities. For example, in the case of a sample research on the Internet, if I cannot find appropriate material in Japanese language websites, I will enlarge my research scope to another language, another country or by digging in forums and local bbs. If I’m not able to find a solution by myself, I won’t be shy seeking the help of my colleagues and eventually of outsourcing relatives. In my past position in an Architecture and Construction company, employees from different sections were often working together. On a river water park project, for example, specialists from city planning group, landscape design group, and hydraulics management group were gathering and made a creative synergy. Therefore I’m convinced that I’m comfortable with this network working process which defines modern companies. Reciprocally, I adopt the positive attitude of letting everyone know about my capacities and knowledge (for example speaking French, knowing about French laws, etc), and that I would be pleased to help, in order to find solutions. In brief, it’s all about a “Give and take” process of cooperation between employees, for the benefit of the whole company.

Frank moved to Guangzhou after long time consideration from another city. Finally he settled down in his new apartment and we had a welcome dinner together last night in a Indonesian restaurant which was absolutely new for me. I have not tried Indonesian food before but similar ones such as Singaporean and Malaysian dishes when I traveled there back to 2007. Southeast Asia food is full of spicy, curry tasting in common. I like it since the influence I got from my previous company, a Singapore based firm in Shanghai. I had good memory both about my pre-boss and good trip in Singapore and Malaysia. I was treated with lots of fun, adventure, foods and for sure can not be forgotten, humid and hot weather. Ok, back to the Indonesian restaurant. It is a tradtional one decorating with local stuff, french window, cane chair with the gentle local background music. I can smell the Indonesian in air. The dishes were really good and mostly important the price is fair too. PS. I came back after long time disconnected with Lang-8. ^_^ Keep in touch, guys.

Hello world! I am preparing my internship in an alternative lifestyle magazine and have to build a portfolio of articles and interviews. Here you have some questions I am gonna ask in my firts interview to an absolutely great and inspiring tattoo artist. any help would be wonderful! I have read in many of your interviews that you define tattooing as “just a job”. Actually, the attitude of most of the tattooists is that they are deities in an exclusive club formed only by a few crew of lucky chosen ones. Have you ever felt that tattooing was the center of your existence, the most important thing in your life? ¿Have you ever felt that sensación of being a “lucky one” because of your job as a tattoo artist, or you have always seen it just like another job?  You are considered a brilliant tattooist, but you also have some fame of being quite “difficult”. Assuming that you do not pretend and that is just the way you are;  did that difference made harder to acquire a reputation in the tattoo world or, on the contrary, you think that you would not have been able to become what you are nowadays without it? Revisiting the point of “what does tattooing means”, ¿do you consider tattoos as a form of art? ¿What kind of real personal expression is possible in a tattoo? You do not do any tattoo you don’t really like or want to do, so, ¿How much can we know about you tough your work? Speaking of influences, when a tattooist is asked, generally talks about another colleagues’ work. However, in your case, I guess that is not so simple. Which are your most destacables external influences for your work?  Finalizing, it is unavoidable to notice your connection with all related with another time, another era: your antiques collection, your past interest with Native Americans or your studio itself Elf ¿When did it all begun? ¿Is that a way to show some kind of unconformity with the days we are living? ¿Can you remember when did you exactly started collecting antiques or you have us grown with it?

You know what, the oral English is the biggest obstacle for me to charge myself.I know how to write,how to read,how to listen,but I don't have any good idea of how to speak it fluently and naturally.I try my best to describe something beyond my reach in English,but there's always failure to show my mind from the bottom of my heart.Absolutely,I'm dummy.I can't share my opinion correctly with each other.Every time I try to ignore my embarrassment to let shyness go,as a result of the shit performance I'm really sick of giving the chance to change again.Oh,my godness,what Can I do with my poor communication in English?I'm insane from A  to Z. It's the hazzard process to make a progress for the seasoned learner. Actually,I want to have an amazing shift of the fault on this aspect.I major in the International Trade,so the ability to speak English is more important than the written one.I just wanan put what I learnt into practice and make them become parts of my future career or life.I hope one day I can have a good commmand of English as well as my mother tongue.God bless me.-ZANE

When I was still in high school I had English lesson, since in Belgium we talk 3 languages and 2 of them are the main languages (French and Dutch) I had only 2 hours of English and then 2 hours of Dutch,...Although I followed at school the Dutch lessons, I couldn't talk Dutch, why? because Dutch it's hard language and if you don't practice what your learn, you'll very fast forget it. French is my native language but I live now in the Dutch area so here I am learning Dutch again, but this time I won't forget my Dutch :pI think that the learning language system is not that good in Belgium, but it's get better since you can study in complet from middle school in English or Dutch.

{Before correcting my text, would anyone please give me a few synonyms of the following expressions?"organic-cotton""products""retailers""fibre""insufficient production""shrink bit by bit"" for the moment."}How green is your wardrobe?Eco-friendly products are more and more appealing to consumers, especially regarding apparel.Textile products made using organic cotton gained a huge popularity in the market.The ecological assets of these products made them fashionable for purchasers but also for both producers and shopkeepers who try to improve their image.Although major retailers feel confident about this special fibre, most producers cannot afford adapting to organic-cotton industry because they fear that demands may prove ephemeral, which has recently led to an insufficient production. As a result, only a pricey small range of products made of organic-cotton are available for the moment. Notwithstanding/STILL, additional charges should shrink bit by bit and  organic-cotton textiles are expected to compete with ordinary cotton in the next few years.Nonetheless, a spate of fake organic-cotton, seemingly impossible to stop, is spreading on the market according to textile industry executives.Wether or not organic-cotton is only a short term fashion is not sure for the moment.

He used to be part of TEAM A, and that`s pretty much what the first half is about, and then he moved and started the new TEAM B.Eisa is a type of okinawan dance were they use taiko drums.>>GreetingLeader's GreetingMy first encounter with the Eisa was back in summer of 2003, when I watched a TEAM A Tokyo Chapter performance for the first time.Under the blazing sun, the group performed with such an intensity that overwhelmed me, and from that day onwards I became a regular spectator of their performances.The following year, I was accepted as a member, and along with the everyday practices I had the chance to stand (appear/ perform?) in many different events and festivals.In 2008, I became Sub-Leader and took the responsibility of transferring everything the older members of the team had tough us to the next generation. I hold dear many precious memories of my experience there.From now on, as leader of TEAM B, I strive to making the most out of my experience in TEAM A and taking it to the next level. My goal is to grow (raise?) a group whose performances can move and impress everyone watching.The formation of TEAM B could not have been possible without the support and aid of many people, which I am most thankful to. Also, as regards to the kindness and warmth we receive from the people who come to see our performances we cannot possibly put our appreciation into words, but instead, into every beat of the Taiko drum we hold, and into every step of our dances, with all of our might (we thank you?).<<This last paragraph may need a lot of work, am I using the word perform too much? I cannot find a suitable synonym. Thank you!!!!>>

Can it exist in a modern world? One of my mates said once that he does not believe in a real friendship, because people so selfish. He was sure that we couldn't do things which weren't beneficial for themselves.IS IT TRUE?I answered that yes, we like to think about ourselves and don't like to think about other people, it is not a good news for us to hear that somebody else's have problems, we like money and sometimes think that friends prevent us to get them, but who are we alone, whithout friends?It is so hard to feel lonely.Friendship exists in a modern world, how without it live?

I want to tell you about the dinosaurs exhibition I visited on Tuesday. I live in Kharkov and there is a very big square in the city centre. Some people say it's the biggest square in Europe. So, every summer something interesting is going on there. For example, last summer there was a so called 'sandy town' in the middle of our square where our citizens could see world-famous sights such as Eiffel Tower, Egyptian Pyramids, Coloseum, Parthenon etc. made of sand. Entrance was free. The only problem was that there were enormous queues.This summer they decided to place a dinosaurs exhibition on the square. The dinosaurs are life-sized and they are made of plastic or something like that. While you're looking around the exhibits you can hear the sounds they used to make - I think it sounds like chirping. I was amazed by the exhibition. It seemed as if I travelled in time. Also we could see a mammoth, a dwarf elefant and an animal that looked like a bear with a long tail but had a completely different name. The most interesting for me were the exhibits of primitive people - they were so short! If you ever happen to be in Ukraine, you definitely should visit Kharkov - you'll find a lot of interesting things there!

Today, I'd like to write on a topic most Japanese learners know little about: pitch accent. Per se, this isn't a personal journal entry as much as a sort of tutorial for the sake of fellow students. To keep it short, I will only briefly touch on certain aspects. Feel free to ask me to elaborate if you have questions. Students are usually taught that Japanese doesn't have stress, unlike English, and that sentences present a rather flat pattern. Unfortunately, that's simply not true. Japanese phrases present a series of high or low syllables that follow certain rules. The default pattern is that the first syllable of a word will be low, followed by high syllables until a downfall occurs. A downfall is a point where a high syllable is followed by a low syllable. Not all words contain a downfall, and whether a given word contains a downfall or not -- and where it is -- must be learned by heart. However, how pitch changes as particles or morphemes are added is predictable.You don't usually need to follow those rules to be understood (save a few exceptions where pitch alone allows a distinction between 2 or 3 otherwise identical sounding words); however, ignoring them will forever confine you to having a foreign accent.Let's look at the verb to eat, taberu, as an example.If we use capitals to mark high syllables, the proper standard Japanese pronunciation of this verb is taBEru. In the negative, we get taBEnai. No surprise here. However, the -te form becomes TAbete. -tai form becomes taBETAi.Why the variation?Pitch is determined from the end of the verb and is assigned by the morpheme added at the end. -nai is a -3 morpheme, which means that the 3rd syllable from the end will be a downfall. Since -nai itself is 2 syllables, it's the previous one that will be high. -te is also a -3 morpheme; however, -tai is -2.Notice also how the second syllable in taBETAi is high too. In standard Japanese (this isn't true in Kansai-ben), the first two syllables must always have a different pitch, so unless the first syllable is high, you will get a low-high pattern. The following syllables will stay high until we reach the downfall.KAeru (to return home) will work the same way, even though the downfall occurs on a different syllable in the dictionary form. Can you guess what the -nai, -te and -tai forms will look like?kaERAnaikaEttekaERITAiThough some of these forms may be surprising, actually, they follow the pattern perfectly. Notice that double consonants count as 2 syllables, which explains ka.E.t.te.If you follow these rules, you will always be able to determine the pitch of a verb with a downfall. I said "verb with a downfall" because verbs without a downfall follow a different pattern (-nai is -2, -te is -0 and -tai is -2). The good news is that these are the only 2 patterns.Listen carefully. You should now start hearing this.

The world is coming to an end. Have you ever realized that? The continual conflicts mostly in developing countries, the huge amount of people suffering from poverty or dying of malnutrition and the really serious problem that is global warming. All these terrible situations are the problems that the earth and international community are facing. If there would be a way of solution, it would be the creation of a world government. By creating a world government would be the best way to create a world order and bring peace to the world. The idea of the creation of a world government appeared when World War Ⅱ ended. The miserable atomic bomb was dropped on Japan and it showed the world what an atomic bomb can do which was all nations can be destroyed, easily. It was then the international community began to think about creating a united government to control the atomic power. In this research paper, it will be indicated the situation the world is in and what we can do to fix it up. In the first, it will be a section about the reasons for a world government. Next, we will go through the history of the development of the world government. At the end, it will be discussed on the problems with the world government working effectively and how to make it work better.​     The international community has forgotten what is happening in the developing countries. Above all, Afghanistan is in a really sirius situation.  And war is all that Afghanistan's children only know. According to the UNCHR, there are about 15.2 million people existing as refugee around the world, of which 20% that is 2.88 million people is said to have come from Afghanistan (2009 Global Trends). The lost country’s economic power, due to the war, has fallen to the lowest in the world. The war in Afghanistan has destroyed everything especially opportunities of education which contributes the essential components of the country. The national literacy rate is only 28%. In addition, the literacy rate goes less than 5% for women in rural areas. Looking at the situations of children, one out of four loses their precious lives by the time they got to five. In a 1997 UNICEF survey, children who experienced or witnessed or, actually, received act of violence during the war is reported to be close to 70% of the all researched amount. There were many poor villages where people’s children had to put out as soldiers in order to obtain food and be able to eat, during the war. Such children, in fact, need the opportunity of education, and it is important that they should be given the environment where they can essentially grow up just like children all over the world, in order to return to the society and contribute to the country’s success in the future. However, an international volunteer association called Shanti (SVA), has reported that there is no text book in Afghanistan while more than 5,000 schools are required, teachers who have received a higher education are only 15%, and to not to increase the generation that cannot receive a normal education, it is an emergency task to obtain the assistance, that is needed, from the international community.(to be continued)

Hi, these are my answers about three questions I was asked. Thanks for your help.1)	There are several Science fiction subgenres; they can be divided into five parts. The first one is the Speculative fiction, which happens in a future world with problems about ethics or racism between humans and a technological advanced being. For example, in Gatacca, Andrew Niccol’s movie, Jerome, a natural human, try to go in space whereas it is reserved for perfect beings. Then, we have the Space opera which takes place in a whole universe, on an interplanetary scale with a lot of species and languages. Star Wars was the first space opera movie but the creator of this subgenre is Isaac Asimov. The next one is (for many, would I say the next ones are?) the Hard science like The Space Odyssey, an Arthur C. Clark’s novel. The Political allegory is another subgenre; George Orwell’s 1984 belongs to it. The last one is the Heroic Fantasy with for example the movie Doomsday.2)	The story of Robots is formed from two times. Before the 60s, robots were seen as a help for humanity, People had a positive view about them. Their rights were restricted by the three Asimov’s laws which defined how a robot must act with a human. Since 60s or 70s, robots have had feelings. They haven’t been necessary good anymore and have even sometimes gotten insane. These modifications have changed the popular idea about robots and they have become devil because they have stolen many jobs.3)	I’d say Frankenstein is a science fiction novel that I’d put in speculative fiction because it’s especially focused on the relationship between Victor, the creator and the monster. Moreover, another main theme is about the exclusion of Frankenstein from the world because he’s different –actually he has a perfect mind but an ugly appearance-. So he gets to hate people and particularly his creator. The decor isn’t the part the most worked but anyway, the novel seems to be a science fiction one because Frankenstein is a creature created by science. Nevertheless, Mary Shelly wrote the work in 1818 so it’s rather a precursory than a real science fiction book.

What is the most difficult when we learn foreign languages ? To me, it's listenning. I'm learning 2 foreign languages ; english and french language. I'm been studing them a long time ago but I always feel difficult, especailly to listen them.To learn both langauges, now I take the class of each language with each native teacher. The class's always funny and interasting but sometimes I cann't understand their words and it makes me so sad. My english teacher says always to all of students "Practice, Practice, Practice". I know I should practice but It's not easy to me, I think. In my case, actually, I feel nerverse and get embarrassed whenever I'm alone with native speaker. Because I'm worried about my poor conversation skills with a foreign language, for example, I'm not sure wheather I understand his words exactly or not. I think this is a big problem for me. To deal with this problem, I think I have to gain more confidences with a foreign language. I will try!!

Hello Everyone, I have posted here a couple of times before, but just in Japanese, I decided to post now in English because it's been more than 2 years since I made the TOEFL exam, I got 583 points in the ITP version, since then I haven't taken any english classes and have been focusing only in Japanese, I'm pretty bad at it or maybe it's because it's a really different-difficult language to learn?, but I will keep going with it =). The problem is that I haven't been practicing English for a long time and I think I'm loosing fluency, if I had it someday, I'm pretty insecure mainly in grammar points, I think I have always been bad with grammar =(, the English I write/speak is just because I get used to it, but when I face up exercises where I need to find an "error" it's really difficult to me, almost impossible. I hope this Journal will keep me aware of my necessity for improving my English and to earn more vocabulary, and of course with your help, help me find those errors that I make and that I'm not aware of. Thank you very much! My mother tongue is Spanish, so any problem you have with it, I will be there for sure, Adios!

I would like to speech a little about music that I love.Because I love too many music, today I will only talk a little about French music.My favourite French band is Noir Désir.The band was created in 80s but they have been known a large success (only in France) only ten year ago with a rock album. The singer of the band is Bertrand Cantat. The lyrics of many songs are very important because they are poetic or politically committed. The band militate against globalization and fascism. For example, the song "Un jour en France" (a day in France) is a song against extreme right and especially the National Front wich is a French far-right and nationalist political party. Here is two amongst lot of beautiful musics : "le vent l'emportera" (with translation of lyrics in the description of the video) and "à ton étoile".







For those who prefer rock music, I highly recommend "Un jour en France", "Comme elle vient", "Tostaky" and "L'homme pressé". My favourite French musician is Yann Tiersen. Maybe you have already hear about him because he composed and played Amelie original sound tracks.Monochome (lyrics are in english, so enjoy !):

[This is a letter of self-introduction. plz read it with your patience.]First of all, I am honored to apply for the subsidiary materials team at NOBLAND. I have a high interest in subsidiary materials because completion of the apparel manufacture depends on exact orders, letting-off and management so that it takes important roles to make apparels high qualities. Among the lots of apparel manufacture companies, NOBLAND regularly satisfies buyer’s needs through lively supports of R&D. Moreover NOBLAND shows record breaking growths since they established. That really motivated me to be a staff at NOBLAND and got a willingness of learning motive power that NOBLAND became the present position.  Since I was a sophomore at university, I started to work as an intern at fashion companies that handle from apparel fabric to ordering and production. I had an internship program at E.LAND as a VMD in 2010 and I have monitored work of staffs and then comprehended two things. Firstly, it is thoroughly preparing data. Always note necessary parts and search the book to gratify lack of work in the given time. Secondly, it is quickness. I prioritize work to achieve goals. These two postures help workflow more flexibly.        For my good points, I have an optimistic personality that I always have a positive mind in facing situations with tendency to find joy in my own behavior.  So, I believe I rarely get stress when compare to other people in the same situation. Moreover talking with people alone, I am able to easily forget about bad memories.  I reckon this is my biggest strength.  For example, I have been left alone in the middle of nowhere while I was having an overseas trip due to the lack of communication skills. However, I considered this event as a charm of the overseas trip, and started to study really hard on foreign languages. I strongly believe that these positive aspects will definitely help me through the situations like having an unexpected trouble with colleagues at NOBLAND.  The other strong point is that I am good at listening.  I believe the communicational errors cause the company loss.  Therefore my strong point is necessary for the position of subsidiary materials which communicate sales team and partner firm.  I would like to be a staff that satisfies buyer’s needs. I am ready to enjoy the work and to be a member of your team.  It would be my pleasure if you contact me (Cell: 010-6622-2850) for further discussion at the interview.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

The Spanish Civil War was a conflict between republicans and nationalists.The rebellion started on July 17, 1936 in Morocco. The day after, the rebellion continued in the Iberian Peninsula.The first objective of nationalists was to take up Madrid and win the war quickly. Nationalists couldn't to take up Madrid because republicans resisted with help of URSS. Then, nationalists tried to cut off Madrid. Nationalists lost the “Batalla del Jarama” and “Batalla de Guadalajara” in 1936.URSS and French helped republicans with International Brigades and tanks called, T-24.Mussolini helped nationalists with tanks called “Fiat Ansaldo”. Hitler too helped nationalists with a terrible troop called Condor Legion.The next objective of nationalists was to take up the north of Spain. The Condor Legion bombed Gernika, and Picasso painted it.Spain was divided in half, so Nationalists began the attack of the Mediterraneo to cut off the republic zone in 1938.Republicans knew that they were losing then they began the battle of the Ebro. Republicans army was massacred and nationalists army could to take up all Catalonia.Republican zone didn't have aliments and the people was hungry.In April of 1939 nationalists won the war and, they took up all Spain without resistence.

This film is a definite must watch. How good is it? I watched it over 80 times!!! That's how good it is. I should have shared it with you guys long time ago. If you want to go to Japan or are going to Japan, I strongly recommend you watch it before you go to Japan. You won't regret it.  This guy, Tyler MacNiven, walked the entire length of Japan back in 2004. It's no mistake. He walked from the southernmost tip of Japan all the way up to the northernmost tip of Japan. That's 2000 miles!! It took him 5 months to complete his, I would say, "odyssey." To him, it was an odyssey of discovering various lifestyles and traditions in Japan and walking into the hearts of the Japanese people, and I'm sure it will be for you, too, when you watch the film as it was for me. This is possibly the best documentary video about Japan ever produced. Maybe, I'm exaggerating a little, but in my mind it's the best.  I laughed, cried, and felt lifted to a better place whenever I watched it. After watching the video, I exchanged some emails with him to learn more about his journey. His contact info is listed on his website: http://kintarowalksjapan.com . Okay. It's getting long. I should stop here. I've embedded the Google video below. Enjoy!  http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3067683435545761102&hl=enI hope you'll watch it and share with me what you thought about it.

Some Americans really like Japan. One of the girl was wearing a t-shirts with "I want Japanese boy-friend!" written on it in Japanese. I never thought American girls like Japanese guys. I asked her "You don't think they're wimpy or short? I was thinking most of American girls like macho guys." and she was like, "Some Japanese are not wimpy. I like Sho Sakurai. He is not wimpy at all and he is really funny." She told me that she really likes Arashi which is one of the most popular idol groups in Japan, and I've really liked that group since I was in high school. We couldn't stop talking about Arashi.

The idea that most arthritis patients will prefer over Xylan appears to be an obvious result with the support of clinical studies about the preference of the drug, Xylan or Xenon, among patients suffering from the most extreme cases of arthritis. Nevertheless, the conclusion that Perkins Pharmaceuticals (PP) will be the most profitable company in ten years overlooks other factors affecting the profit. First of all, the fact that the patent of the Becton Pharmaceuticals (BP) expires in three years does not naturally point out that BP will not receive a profit any more. It is possible that BP would also manufacture the cheaper version of the drug and as a result BP would earn a profit because of its good reputation. In addition, it might be a possibility that BP would produce a new drug that could be more effective for the treatment of arthritis than any other drug. Until the arguer offers the information of BP's business strategies in the future, I remain unconvinced that BP would not be profitable.The studies in the argument are also unreliable. When evaluating the evidence of the clinical studies about the use of Xylan, a new drug curing arthritis, one needs to examine how representative the studies are. Could the most extreme arthritis patients represent all the arthritis patients? It might be the case that Xylan only has an effect on the most extreme patients and instead has little, even no, effect on other patients. One also needs to consider how large the sample is. If the number of patients studied is only a small portion, the result might be untenable--perhaps most other patients may prefer Xenon to Xylan. Moreover, one needs to take into account the procedure of the study. Is the question asked in the study misleading? Is the study conducted just by PP? Is the study limited to the arthritis patients of a certain hospital, even the same physician in charge? Alternative explanations could account for the study results and then could weaken the claim that PP will be the most profitable company in the next ten years. In addition, even if Xylan is popular among the arthritis patients, however, PP would not necessarily be a tremendously profitable company. After all, profit is determined by revenue and expense. Perhaps the arthritis patients would choose operation instead of drugs as the treatment method; or perhaps the arthritis patients in the survey just express their preference over Xylan and in fact they would not purchase Xylan because they might be highly concerned with the new drug's safety. For that matter, PP would not receive a profit in ten years. What is more, there is no information about the costs involved in manufacturing Xylan in the argument. Common sense informs us that usually producing a new drug needs new process, new equipments and new materials, which contributes to a high cost. Moreover, the arguer fails to consider the existing and potential competitors that would challenge PP's position.Finally, even assuming that PP would be profitable, the assumption that there are only two mutually exclusive choices, BP or PP, in the competition of becoming the most profitable company is unwarranted. Perhaps in the next ten years many other companies would earn a profit by producing not only newer but also more effective than PP.In sum, the argument appears logical at first glance, but actually it is unpersuasive. To bolster it the arguer must provide clearer information about the future business strategies of BP and the representativeness of the studies. To better evaluate the conclusion, I need to know PP's business condition. I also need to know what competition PP would face in the next ten years.

Hi, I introduce me to you guys :-)My name is Asami. I live in Osaka JAPAN.I have some website, one is Aupair Japan(http://www.aupair-japan.com/), another is AJF(http://family.aupair-japan.com/), and my blog named iGirl(http://d.hatena.ne.jp/asami81/).I had been an Aupair in the U.S. for 1 year when I was 24.

I found something quite interesting on the internet today. A video of the animated series of Marvel Super Heroes. A chapter of the adventures of Mighty Thor.I remember have seen it before, when I was a kid.Of course, it was the spanish dub then, so its like a new experience to see it in its original language, english.The animation is quite limited, in fact the animators used the original comics to create the animation. Despite its tecnical flaws and poor animation, I still think is very cool.The elemtents of fantasy and action and the narrative is quite epic as only comics can be.Most of the characters are comic versions of mitological norse gods and their manner of speech is fantastic. I like their speech very much but sometimes i just dont get what are they saying like:Odin: "Silence! the thunder god´s word is his bond/bound(¿?)"Thor: "I shall return to Asgard to endure the trial of the gods"Odin: "So be it(¿?)"I find the use of such words and expresions facinating, but, guess I´ll sound dumb if i use them......

Maybe I should find something readers can have an interest from my daily life.Today, I watched the movie named School of Rock starring Jack Black and Joan Cusack.  As a matter of fact, I have a DVD of this movie so it was a second time to see this movie. However still I was able to enjoy it.If you love rock music, you might want to see this movie.In this movie, Led Zeppelin's famous song, 'Immingrant song' was used.

The graph shows the annual amount of the wheat exports from 1985 to 1990 in two countries and one region. Wheat export in Australia has been declining for three years straight from 1986 to 1989, though there was a slight rise from 1985 to 1986. It remained mostly in the same from 1989 to 1990. As a whole, wheat export in Australia decreased from 15 million tons to 11 million tons. On the other hand, European community experienced constant rise with exception from 1985 to 1986. In this period, the amount dropped approximately 3 tons from 17tons to 14 tons. Following two years, there was no remarkable rise. But from 1988 to 1990, European community had tremendous rise from 15 tons to 21 tons. Finally, Canada experienced unpredictable up and down in this period. First of all, there was a small down from 1985 to 1986. Following two years, Canada encountered very big rise from 17 tons to 25 tons which was followed by the biggest drastic decline of 11 tons. However, after this extreme decrease, Canada showed amazing resilience. The amount of wheat export increased from 14 tons to 19 tons.

I cannot agree with the statement. In my opinion, the integration of the modern IT into the educational sphere have not revolutionised the initial principles of education.Certainly, the higher efficiency was reached with the help of the things discussed. It is thanks to computers and the Internet that the speed of gaining knowledge is accelerating now and more people have access to the widest ever range of educational resources.Yet, let us remember that introducing printed books to the public in the Middle Ages did quite the same job: education stopped being so exclusive, the teacher's task became simplified.To sum up, the very idea of interaction between teachers and students, to my mind, is still the same: teachers give knowledge, students collect it. However great help computers and the Internet provide, they only represent the latest aids to learning.

 Hi, my name is Sebastián. This is the first time I write here at Lang-8, and to be honest it’s hard for me to decide  what to talk about, but if you don’t make up your mind and practice you’ll never improve, so here I go… I’m studying English and Japanese. I use the computer and internet a lot for studying, which has given me access to several and great tools that every language learner should have access to, like blogs, forums, podcasts, sowftware and others.. As for English, its pronunciation is hard, but reading isn’t that much hard. Besides, on internet there are amazing amounts of information in English about any subject. For example, I like stuff related to the use of computers and internet for both leisure and learning, and read sites like Lifehacker and Wikipedia  and several others everyday. Actually, I’ve learned a lot of English by reading and writing at sites about learning Japanese. On the other side, reading Japanese is something that takes lots of time and effort. Even something as “simple” as reading the newspaper isn’t that “simple” at all. Fortunately, I study kanji using a book called “Remembering the Kanji” by James Heisig, and also spaced repetition softwares for kanji and Japanese in general, which has helped me a lot not just to actually learn, but also to feel much more motivated to keep on learning. As I said above, the use of the computer and internet has helped me a lot. I think this is the best moment to learn languages, as practically anything you need can be found on internet, and even for free. For example, Lang-8 is a great tool for every language learner, so I hope it keeps on having great success. ¿What do you think?

I haven’t practiced my English, this is too bad. But I have to practice; I try to think in English. Sometimes, when I’m walking around the street I remind all the things that I did during the day or the things that I want to do; in English, this is my daily practice.I’ve been busy with the schools and the period of tests; is awful! A lots of things to do, to study. This semester was good; I learned a lot of things and I visited many museums and galleries. I also made friends and this does the school-time more enjoyable. Next semester is going to be good. I’m going to have photography lessons; that’s very exciting! The bad new is that I must buy a camera and with the economical crisis, they are too expensive!.

I find the best way to studying foreign language is reciting classic and exellent text.It is heart-stirring if there are some foreigners who are in the same residential area with you could talk to you everyday, but maybe it is not everyone have the advantages, so, as a language learner, we must find more probable conditions to practise. As time goes by, I think reciting is a good way to elevate language studying to a new level.When I was a university student, I was so boring about reciting new words, It seems that the appearances of new words and expressions always like hurricane or storming everyday. At first time I was scared to face them, then I thought I couldn't just like a rat in a hole and waited to death(of course the final exam...), so I began to recite proses and poems, finally it works.At present, I continue my Japanese studying and I find it is hard to use the same method. The fact is Japanese text always use many characters without kana, at most time I don't know how to pronunce the new words when I face them, so I must check them by dictionary, it is really a big problem! But I am optimistic about the future, I think there must be a hard time, not just to me but also to every language learner, when I pass it, I'll find come through finally.Just do it! ~

This year we will work for a better using of the french language in writtings and we will try to discover other cultures by written correspondence with some class around the world. I think it would be a great experiment. Why not exchanging mails and stuffs with a Japanese school? What do you think Kokki ? ;)This is the end of my first text. I hope you'll not get blind by reading my words. God will apologise... Will you?

My first time writing in English.It is a mail for a potential job.I did my best, hope you can correct me!!!Thanks guys!In my opinion, what your client asks is that the game is culturally appropriate, that is to say that language, the vocabulary used must be consistent with the type of game (RPG, horror, sports ... ) and it takes into account the target: a young, adolescent, adult.The vocabulary, the language is completely different depending on whether you play Assassin's Creed or Animal Crossing.The choice of terms is crucial. A "fighter" is different from a "warrior". In France, the connotations behind these two words are strong, a fighter is a man (or woman), a soldier marching in campaign under the orders of a leader, he is part of an army. Instead, when we speak of a warrior other ideas are grafted to the vocabulary. Words such as respect, fear, ridicule, fighting, pride, anti-conformism, defense of ideals, code of honor ...You see the difference?In an RPG, the player identifies with the character. The fact that he can rename and use his real name is a clear proof of this desire for identification, both from the player and the part of developers.To go to the end of the adventure, the player must be motivated: it is the language that makes the bridge between the player and the image, which makes the real world.If the language rings false, the player can not submerge completely and leave for later, having failed to "enter" in this worldIt is not enough there is a cultural recognition, language does not betray the game We must put into the mouth of the character of words he could say. Asassin's Creed published in Germany: Ezio hungry. Will he ask to eat sauerkraut ?????We are in Italy at the time of Leonardo da Vinci, I doubt he can find tripe. The example is a bit much, I admit. But it's better to illustrate my point.The game is for players, it is necessary that players are attracted by the game They need a language attractive by his choice and his job.However, a game for a young target must not be too typed too childish or too complicated, a balance between the two: a language to create an emotional connection between game and player. As I've said in my previous mail, I'm playing since the age of 12 years.Since Tetris, Navy Seals on Atari computers, the saga of Final Fantasy (which I wait with impatience opus XIII), the Resident Evil saga, games online like Bitefight ... I do not know all the list. The latest one is Assassin's Creed, published by Ubisoft, a true gem.I also translate manga for almost 8 years, which gives me good experience in the choice of terms and especially in the levels of language figures as diverse as aristocrats or a rock band.I am also part of a reading committee for a publishing house, Editions du Petit Caveau, specializing in vampire novels and novellas.  I am also correcting for them. The next novel called Les LoupsKharkov by Alexis Lorens, was corrected by me.. Write a thematic guide to the use of novice translators in particular world of video games is an idea that appeals to me.

    As we all konw, there exist a lot of differences between two kinds of languages, for example, English and Chinese. I am very proud of being a chinese and I am very fond of my native language. However,  the habits of speaking chinese set numerous difficulties when I am learning English.     In fact, I am very good at reciting words. It seems that keeping English words in mind for a long period of time is very hard for chinese students, but it is very easy for me no matter how many words there are.    I am very worried about my listening and writing skills. I can only get 50% of total scores when we have an English exam. My English teacher has ever told me:"Reciting English words only is useless unless you know how to use those words." I tried many ways but I ended with failure every time. I don't know how to improve my English listening and writing skills.  I sincerely hope that any one here can give me a hand.

Last year we made decision to spend our holidays abroad. We went to the travel agency and agent offered to us a several good hotels and itenararies. We chose one that was optimal cost / quality. Then we filled out some papers work and recived our tour packages in that was included airfare (tickets was bought in advanced): two round-trip tickets, insurance and temporary medical policy. So we packed our rolling duffle bag with zip lock and at the appointed day and went to the Rostov airport by bus.We arrived at 12 o'clock p.m., walked through the metal detector And looked at the information desk the flight number and departure time. But boarding and flight began at about 4 o'clock a.m. We had to wait 2 or 3 hours in the waiting hall before custom control started, good film helped us to while away the time. At 2 o'clock we cleared the custom, went trough passport control, took our tickets, boarding passes and were allowed to go through the green channel. Staff of the airport weighted our luggage and we took heavy and bulky bags to the luggage van. Departure time was declared and boarding started. The flight was on time. I had window seat and Yuri had aisle seat. When we returned we sat near the emergency exit. Flight attendant asked us to do full upright position of the seat and fasten our seat belts, fligth started.Soon snacks and beverage was brought. We flew over cities and they seemed like a brigth beautiful web on a dark groud.When we arrived we went the same procedure as was in Rostov airport, but airport was bigger and more modern: elevators, big digital information desk, plants, big duty free, fountain, where the passengers thrown coin. And finnaly we were waited by travel agent who accompained to the hotel by bus. It was good hotel, all was include: meal, alcohol and entertainment. We were registred at the reception and we recived bracelets as sign belonging to this hotel. Porter showed our room and we decided to relax a little because of jet lag. We walked on air! To lay on a beach with a bocal of martini is great! The day before departure we changed rubles on lirs at the currency exchange and bought souvenirs for our relatives. It was resceduled the flight on 2 or 3 hours, and we could to have breakfast and to enjoyed sea a little more, took some pictures. Resort was passed with flying colours!

Hello.The reason that I registered on this site is that my friend is studying English on this site.There is word "Mikka Bouzu" in Japan. "Mikka" is three days."Bouzu" is priest in Japanese temple.The priest stoically continues the regular life. The normal person cannot continue them even if it aims at the priest, and will give it up in three days.This episode is an origin of  "Mikka Bouzu".What is "Mikka Bouzu" said in English?The translation site was answered as "Person who cannot stick to anything". I cannot understand whether it is the same meaning. I study English little by little because I want you not to call me "MikkaBouzu".------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------はじめての日記：「三日坊主」って英語で何て言うの？こんにちは。なぜ私がこのサイトに登録したかというと、友人がこのサイトで英語を勉強していたからです。日本には「三日坊主」という言葉があります。「三日」はThree daysのこと。「坊主」は日本のお寺の僧侶、Priestのこと。僧侶は規則正しいストイックな生活を送っています。だけど僧侶を目指す人はそれが続けられずに３日で諦めてしまいます。そこから「三日坊主」という言葉になったのです。英語でも「三日坊主」を意味する言葉はあるんでしょうか。翻訳サイトは「Person who cannot stick to anything」と訳していました。同じ意味かどうかは分かりません。「三日坊主」って呼ばれてもいやなので、ちょっとずつ英語を勉強しようと思います。

Today's topic is "Do you prefer learning by yourself to learning with a teacher?":::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: In my opinion most of people prefer learning with a teacher rather than learning by themselves. For example, when you go to primary school, junior high school or high school there must be a teacher and a teacher teach some subjects for students. Thus It is no doubt most of people think learning from a teacher is common. Besides, it is true when you learn some difficult thing, for instance, math or science studying by yourself is very hard and learning from a teacher is the easiest things. However, from my experience I forgot most of a things which I learned from my teacher because thanks to my good teacher he taught me so easily so I just understood on that time. Therefore, from this reason I prefer learning by myself. I will write some advantages of learning by myself as follows. First of all, you can memorize for a log time compare with learning from a teacher. For example, when I tied to study for a university entrance exam I  learned some english vocabulary or the famous history person's name by heart everyday. Unlike learning easily from a teacher I had to write many time on paper to memorize and it also need patience. Thanks to this studying I can remember most of part now. Next is that you can study for own pace. If you teach from teacher you have to preparation which you will do next day so that you don't afford to study what you want to do. However, learning by yourself you don't need preparation and you can feel relax to study. Of course, you can make your own schedule and do as you want to study. Therefore, learning  by yourself is the most efficient way to study.

Hey, guys! A topic which I find fascinating is politeness and rudeness in English. I've noticed that being polite in English-speaking cultures is extremely important, whereas it's not so in Argentina. For instance, I've been told that saying "What?" when you haven't understood what somebody has just said is not good manners. Instead, you should say: "I'm sorry, could you repeat that?", "Sorry, didn't quite catch that". Do you agree with this? Could you give me any more examples of politeness and rudeness in English? Thanks =)

Some people think that more severe gun laws are the solution to the problem of gun violence. In the USA, the population can have guns.According to me, severe gun laws are not the solution to the problem of gun violence in the USA, because an association that wants people to have guns, for exemple the NRA.Futhermore, the problem in the USA is that the children take guns tto their parents or it's their parents give it to their children. Consequently if the children has a psychological problem the fact that he carries a gun is dangerous for exemple a boy that shoot his parents ans his sister.In addition, the secont amendement in the USA is that the population can have guns, people can buy a firearm all the months. The consequence is that more and more people kill it's the statistics that say it.To conclude, severe gun laws are not the solution to the problem of gun violence in the USA because the second amendement is that people can have guns. Consequently they are more and more problems of violence and the children make this violence.In my opinion, the people of America must stop to buy firearms.

I hope it helps me to improve my English, and, of course, I hope I can help other people to improve their Spanish as well by correcting them.This is my first message, and, as I have no idea what I could talk about, I'm just going to talk about cats, since I just corrected a Spanish entry whose topic was cats.I have had 5 cats up until now, but sadly, all of them already passed away. However, I will always remember them no matter what. All of them were very cute and playful, and at the same time, each of them was unique on his own way. I couldn't choose (pick?) one over the others, but there's one who was with me during my whole life until he died several months ago. He was a black, big, chubby cat. My parents took him with us when I was a baby and he had quite a large life - he lived for almost 18 years.I hope all of them are happy in the cats' heaven!

But trouble comes after, Echo is not a common girl's English name in foreign countries, people often made the wrong pronunciation when first saw this name, I was tired to correct them again and again, so I change my name to Yanina, easy to speak it out, and the first three letters are just the same as my Chinese given name, the first time I saw this name, I told myself that was for me. Now you know me, Yanina Hou, from China, I'll never change my name again.

I haven't bought lottey tickets at all.In the Middle Age, economy was controlled by religions that prohibits earning interest.Sometimes I suppose that there was a lottey in the Middle Age, and someone bought it. what happened?In my opinion, people included Priest may call whom buy lottery Satan. At last, they burnt to death.The background of lottery is that economy has become free from religion,and it has been developed as the rule of  society.The Korea national lottery called LOTTO has introduced in 2002.The catchphrase of advertisement was "To be rich, You can be rich"I haven't seen rich people who buy lottery,Usually people who buy lottery are not rich.Besides they have to pay 50% in tax.I think it's a kind of paradox. Government tell the people who are not rich to be rich, rather government become rich.

Hi everyone, I hope you take this into account because I am a really hardworking person who wants to improve her English no matter how many times she's told she's got a Chinese accent, her grammar is weak sometimes or whatsoever.It has always been for me an understandable thing whether I talk or write in an acceptable way. I just want to learn English in a natural way because what I've noticed about my English is that I tend to exaggerate everything I say and as a consequence I sound fake it seems...That's why I'm travelling to the States this year...when Dec arrives. I think It'll be the 13th like at 7 o' clock.It should be an awsome experience because Ive never been abroad and Im quite a little girl though Im 21...Im supposed to work in there and I dont even know how to cook or clean because everything I've wanted has been gioven to me froma very early period. So, as you may have noticed this is going to be quite an adventure for me. I am gonna miss a lot of people and think Ill be missed for some. I want to buy lots of things and have some short holidays...However it won't be possible as Ive come to accept. Ive decided to go to the States even though I could use that money in order for my sister to study something at some university or whatever institution for superior studies...This is not going to be easy.Definetely. I just know that I make a big effort so that I do not lose my job and...that I can send money to my family..because hard times will come and gotta be strong...God's gonna be there...

I'm not a big fan of the social network craze. I even deactivated my Facebook account a while ago because of their disgusting disrespect for users' privacy and generally low utility value. However, I've decided to join lang-8 today as it seems to be a great social network for language learners where I can improve my English while helping others learn my native language.By the way, does anyone know the story behind the name "lang-8"?

Now, outside the rain, and temperatures around 15 degrees. Two days ago it was very hot. And it's very strange. Memories of this make me melancholy. Another recall how the night was returning home from work and was held in the Metro to move past the guy. He got out of the case balalaika. While I was standing on the platform of music sounded. So fine, ringing voice, calmly. Train was a long time. I enjoyed. It seems that the music was in me.

First, keep in mind it's not a diary, it's a summary of a Korea Times by myself-------------------Defense Minister Kim Tae-young tendered his resignation for the responsibility about North Korea's shelling at Yeonpeong Island. And it was just start the whole sale revamping of military. Recently the military have many problems. For example, Cheonan sinking, many military planes going down, and capsizing a army boat. So, they needed some reform in many fields. But they didn't. So here are 2 civilian victims now. The military reform should start from fair personnel management. Above all, they will need our cheering and trust.

I could not imagine this situation before I started sitting here and wondering what I can actually accomplish . To me it is awful that my new workmates are ladies over 30, and that during this whole day they just kept on talking about their babies which is a topic I have nothing to express, so I feel a little bit estranged(Is this word correctly spelt?). The worst part is they asked me to do basic work like filling in forms which definitely could not be more boring and time-wasting. I just began to question myself why I am here.Hope things would be better the day after tommorrow, as I will take a rest on Thursday!

One of the games children played when I was child is called "matagente", which is a kind of dodgeball. It's played with a group of people and a designated couple that flanks them. The couple passes the ball each other, trying to hit the people between them. When they hit a person, he/she goes out of play. The last person left wins the game.Another game popular on that age (specially among girls) is jacks ("yases" in Peru). Here, we play with six jacks. The player throws a rubber ball and takes the jacks before the ball makes more than one bounce. First, one takes the jacks one by one, later two by two, and so on, until take the six jacks in one move. Later, one plays again one by one, but with additional actions: banging on the floor before taking the jack, taking in two steps, taking without even a ball bounce, or a combination of these and others.

This summer vacation I have spent in Italy! It was one of the best summer vacations for me!I was here when I was 4 years old with my parents. Of course I was too young and I remember very little about our trip! My parents and I visited different cities: Rome, Venice, Vatican, but this year I've seen more.It was my first independent trip, a present from my parents! I had a week of excursions and a week on the sea.I'll try do describe the most important in my trip.First of all the flight was carried over for the reason of air weather. So I had do wait for 10 hours more! It was a little discomfort for me because I was alone in the airport.After 10 hours I was in the sky and my trip had started!I arrived to the Rimini airport in the evening of the local time and the bus carried me to the hotel in San Marino.Next day I saw the group of people with whom I would spend a week in the excursions around Italy. They were nice and sometimes strange. but I find some interesting persons among them! For example, a teacher of French. She is 70 years old, but she likes to travel, she visited different countries and places. It was very interesting to talk with her!This day we got into Venice. Today everybody can read about every place in the internet, so I would tell you only emotions, but not describe the places that I have seen.it should be noted that I am an architect student and this trip was important for me from the viewpoint of architecture.Venice was great! I thought that nothing could be better. But It' was not right! Next day we visited Florence. It was a place where I wanted to go again. I felt a sense of greatness of spirit of the Italian culture walking around the observation point. There are 2 interesting towns: Siena and Pisa near with Florence. I saw them. I liked Siena for it's cathedral and Pisa for Pisa tower. I walked up the stairs to the up of the tower. It was exciting feeling and I saw a wonderful panorama of Pisa.Besides I was in Rome. One day I had excursion with the guide and next day I walked around Rome with one member from our group! It was one of the best moment of my trip! I was here from 8 a.m. till 11 p.m. In the end of the day I was very tired but I felt my self happy!We visited Vatican in the last day of the week and after we had a week on the Adriatic sea! I lived in Rimini and I want only to have sun bath and to swim in the sea after so informative and eventful week. The sea in Rimini is good. Somebody says that It's dirty, but I think that he doesn't sea black sea)) In the morning the sea is calm, but in the evening It's cool to swim in waves! I didn't want to come back to Russia, because It was really good, but I'm sure that I'll go to Italy again!

Day before yesterday, 2010 world cup continental heat was finished.Everything goes as we expected but amazing problem occurred in the end.Thierry Henry, a great French striker, made a mistake.He touched the ball. And the ball was 'handed out' to his teammate William Gallas. then he got the game point. France defeated Ｉreland.As you might know, this news spread quickly to the world.In Japan, Henry was known to people who isn't interested in football as a dirty player.In addition to this, Ireland's prime minister requested FIFA to play over against France.(This request was not granted.)His only one mistake resulted serious problem.However,  I believe the French didn't intentionally break the rules. It is natural for sportsman especially uses ball to respond.He got many titles in his career such as MVP and Getting high scores in England. His goal brought innumerable win to his team.I can't think such a great player breaks the rules in person. In other words, a person who is dirty,not serious to football can't get such a excellent career.What do you think? Please give me some opinions.Thank you for reading!

It always killed me that I will never speak English as a native speaker. All these verbs & fraseology. Every time I speak, I slip somewhere and a real-English-person can see it. When I go in the street & slip & fall & somebody sees it I get this inconvenient feeling. On the other hand, practice is the only difference between me & that imaginary native speaker.

I think this module helps is aimed to teach students how to prepare and plan their learning, performance and desired achievement. It is designed to make sure that students can have a better preparation so that they can gain as much as they can from this module. It provides students reflect on their personal, education and helps students learn how to development they better in the future. After attending all the lectures of this module I learned a lot. WHAT I HAVE LEARNEDAfter learning this module, the clearest thing what I learned is the awareness about my own personal development has been improved. Before the studying I did not really care about personal development. I even did not think about it at all. What is more, I learned how to prepare for my own studying and life. One of the most useful things for my daily life I learned is time management. I think I can manage my time much better than before. I set my priorities, wrote diary lists, have an everyday followed time patterns and also have some mini-goals for each steps. This is one of the evidence what I did for my time management. It helped me to clearly see what I have to do every day for each time. I did things much more efficiency. I also learned many ways of notes taking. There is what I did when I writing an essay before. Many knowledge and skills I have learned. For example, I learned research skills, writing for different audiences/ reports, essays, presentations and incorporation of IT, Critical evaluation, soft skills and employability and so on. CHAGED VIEWS OF MINEI thought we do not need to prepare for the lecture in university. I thought the lecture was as boring as the lecture in my high school. In china, in high school, we have a steady format which is teacher is speaking on the stage and students only copy the things he wrote on backboard. I thought we only need to review the knowledge we learned from class when we back home. While, all of those views changed after this module. Preparation is very important for lecture, especially for foreigner students. It helped us easier to understand the knowledge. The language problem would not stop me understanding the lecturer. At the same time, after preparation I knew the important point clearer. Moreover, the way of teaching is total different form the lecture in high school in China. We did not to copy teacher’s writing. The only thing we have to do is taking note. While taking all of the things I heard is not very necessary. On the other hand, only the knowledge I studied in class is not enough, I not only have to review the knowledge learned from class, but also have to learn more after class by ourselves.  So some of mine views have been changed since learned this module. GOOD FOR MY FUTURE PERSONAL DEVELOPMENTI do think this module is helpful for my personal development. I do really think some of the knowledge is really good for my future work and life. I hope I can use the knowledge efficiency in future work and life. I hope in one day, in my work, when I have some difficult problem, then suddenly I remember this module told me what I can do at this time. It is my expectations for the future. However, sometimes when I am studying in the university, it seems like the knowledge does not make big sense, while I am definitely sure that I will find some of the knowledge is very useful in my future in one day. Furthermore, I think manager is a good type of work for me. Opening my own company is my biggest dream. I think it might be reconciled with my personal values. I think I have the characteristics of a good manager, such as great planner, filofax user, psion organisers, and schedulers. I see changes as another exciting challenge. I do not the life always the same, and I do not like the work which is no any changes. I will feel so bored nothing changed. On the other side, changes give me more motivation.SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTSI think in the future lecture, we may try one or two activities, such as visiting companies. It could be made to make the module more useful for students. If students only listen the lecture in university, it is a little bit limited, while going to an existing company could be more directly learning way. I hope in future’s lecture, I can learn more knowledge about how manage time more efficiency because I am a little bit weak about this part while it is very important for my future life. What is more, in my opinion, there is some way for the module to help students have better awareness about their personal development. For example, show some good personal development example to students, asking them to come to the lecture could be a very good effect way. To sum up, I think after learning this module, learned a lot. I understood the concept and process of continuing professional development, and how it applies to undergraduate study and beyond. I understood the self-development process, as applied to my study. I hope I can continue learning knowledge from this module and use the knowledge very well in the future.

  College life may be lonely for you now, especially when you are autistic and long for love. but never be cheated by it ,you can gain friendship in such a great circumstance ,and that may be some of your greatest possession in your life. ­  I realized this the first day I came to Guilin university of electronic technology. Yes, universities are completely different from senior high schools, but there are still some people mistaken it. they persist in the version that we should pay more attention on communication and try to find a girlfriend(boyfriend) , but not study hard. However, for us majoring in electronic information engineering, it is wrong. I'd admit that social intercourse is essential, but being proficient at your major is also of great significance. ­  For me, I've ever lost my heart to a girl when in senior high school, but what I don't know is that she had already fell in love with another boy, now, things all gone, but I can still get some reminiscences.­  From that , I learned to go myself. I've been sad at that time though, today, I am, to be honest, still happy, 'cause I enjoy parental love, friendship and study thought no love(maybe I have never own love,that's merely unrequited love) ­  In college, owning love is best ,being lonely is also great. if you still remain single, try to live yourself, try to care about everyone you want , 'cause you have no scruple. ­You see! your roommate is asleep, isn't he very cute? Look around your campus, it's really beautiful!…… ­Is life wonderful? Yes! though lonely without love, you actually own much. ­Just remember, no love for loneliness! when it comes, it comes!­

Hello, I'm writing down my first post in this site in order to see if it works properly, that is, if I can use it to improve my writing skills and, also, to help others to improve their skills writing my lovely native language, Catalan. By the way, as many Catalan speakers suffer, we also could correct Spanish entries but it seems that, since we can only choose one language to correct, we can not select it. Does anybody know how to fix this?

Language is a tool for communication and mother tongue is anchor of our life and spirit. Ones should really master their own mother tongue firstly if you want to learn a foreign language very well. Chinese is our mother tongue. She sounds beautifully and is full of wisdom. I believe that the Chinese is a sagacious old man all the time. I enjoy writing down all of my feeling of life in Chinese and appreciate the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature.Now I am going to study some foreign languages such as English, Japanese and Italian because they are beautiful as same as Chinese. I am sure that learning foreign languages has a positive effect on the development and use of mother tongue skills.

Hi!  My name is Alex (Sasha in Russian) and I'm from Belarus.I emigrated to the United states almost five years ago and I live in Brooklyn, NY.Unfortunately I have no one to speak with and have no abilities to practice my English. This is very sad - to live in English speaking country and have no way to speak and learn language that is all around you. :(When I first came to the United States I didn't know a single word in English.  I remember standing in the McDonalds the first day I came trying to order a French-fries and diet coke - I opened the mouth and... nothing came from it. I was standing and mumbling something. that was horrible.So, I watched TV and read books - this is the way I learned English.From now on I will write here some thoughts about everything what bothers me. About emigration and cultural differences, about feelings, about America and my view on it.Can you please help me to correct my mistakes? Not only grammatical flaws but also the way I speak. Cause the language is not only the words and grammar rules, it is also THE WAY you speak, the way you express your thoughts.  Many people speaking foreign language often speak it in a very strange way - the way that natives never speak. Because different languages have different structures and different 'language tools' to express same things.  I hope you understand what I'm talking about.Thank you.

Hello! I would like fixing the english part...Thank you in advance :)In the beginning of the twentieth century, the young intellect who underwent a baptism of the modern thought began to lead a revolt against Confucian culture and 　advocate the rights of the Individual. However, It is very difficult for them to get rid of filial piety to mother. Because they were born and grow up in Chinese traditional family system, saw that their mother who restrained and suppressed by old restriction sacrificed herself to bring up themselves, therefore their gratitude to mother were extremely strong.In this paper the focus is on HuShi , and his suffering for conflict between his ideal and filial piety to his mother. He was one of leading and influential intellectuals during the New Culture Movement in China, promoted vernacular Chinese in literature, advocated the rights of the Individual and “Free love”. However, at the same time, he received mother's instruction, married Jiang Dong-xiu who had bound feet and illiterate. After all, HuShi can not get rid of filial piety through life, but in the limited condition, he makes an effort to approach the ideal even a little. We can see that such HuShi's keen desire is reflected in the image of mother in his autobiography“Sishi zishu ”.【日本語】胡適の結婚と『四十自述』の母親像二十世紀初頭、近代思想の洗礼を受けた若い知識人は、「個」の権利を主張し、儒教社会を打破しようと努力した。しかし旧社会の家庭に生まれた彼らは、自らの母が古い慣習に抑圧されながらも、多くの犠牲を払って自分を育てくれたのを見てきた。そのため母への感謝の気持ちは極めて強く、往々にして母に対する「孝」から脱却するのは難しかった。この論文では胡適と、彼の理想と母親への「孝」の葛藤に焦点を当てる。胡適は中国近代の新文化運動の中心人物であり、文学革命とともに「個」の解放、自由恋愛による家庭革命を主張した。しかしその最中、母の命により江冬秀と結婚している。彼女は纏足の文盲の女性であった。結局のところ、胡適は一生のあいだ「孝」の呪縛から脱せなかったのだが、限られた条件の中で少しでも理想に近づこうと努力したのだ。胡適の自伝『四十自述』に描かれた母親像には、そうした胡適の切実な思いが反映されているのである。

After having been working in Japan for more than two years, i am really tired from my present job. When i was still in the colleage, i supposed working as an engineer was just doing something purely and there was no need to deal with the trivial things. But after i joined in my company, i found i was totally wrong.In my department, i have to connect with the customers to confirm the specification of the product, i have to make all the  documents which are necessary to submit to the customers, and sometimes i have to coordinate with other departments to ensure the production. i thought engineer is purely to design something, but now i consider myself to be a project manager other than a designer. It really made me crazy and i am thinking of making a change.

Since 10 years ago I have lived in Peñalolén, one of the 32 communes of the Greater Santiago in the Metropolitan Region. Peñalolén (in Mapudungun “fraternal meeting people”) was founded on 15 of November of 1984, and since that year, it has had five mayors; the current one is Claudio Orrego.Specifically, I live in Cousiño Macul Park Condominium, one of many condominiums here are. It is located around a Jumbo supermarket, a school, and many minimarkets, so it is for sure a very convenient place to live.Peñalolén has 4 areas or little neighbourhoods: High Peñalolén, Lo Hermida, La Faena and San Luis of Macul, and it also has a lot of green areas, such as Viña Cousiño Park, Quebrada de Macul and Arrieta Park, among others.I think my neighbourhood is a very convenient one, because it has a great amount of supermarkets (many Jumbo and Lider), schools (such as Pumahue School and Mayor School, where I studied), universities (SEK International University and Adolfo Ibáñez University, one of the most technological and also expensive universities in Santiago), and also a lot of parks and local markets attended by local people where neighbours can buy fruits, vegetables and even clothes and furniture at lower prices.One of the great things I think Peñalolén has to offer to the community, and also to visitants, is its many touristic attractions. Only in this commune, there are 10 different places to visit, enjoy, and learn more about its history and people. For example, you can choose among: Arrieta’s Old Estate House and Park, Mapuche’s Rhuka Kimn, where you can learn about the Mapuche’s culture and even meet some of them, Peace and Commemoration Park Villa Grimaldi, Cantalao Native Forest Centre, Quebrada de Macul Park’s Andean Mountain Gap, Cousiño Macul and Aquitania Vineyards, La Rosa and El Sol Arts and Handicrafts Towns, and the Ecological Community, all with their beautiful sights and special charm.If you have the opportunity to visit Peñalolén, come and enjoy its beauty and what it has to offer to anyone who wants to have an awesome time.

#=#=# Practicing talking about myself in English #=#=#Topic 1: About my job history - 3/3Oops, it's too long... I hope you aren't fed up with it.--------------------The next is the 3rd phase; I started working as a freelance training consultant. Since then, I have shifted my specialty from IT to human resource development training gradually, because most companies' requirement for training has been changed. I conducted various training such as leadership training, manager skill traning, training for new graduates/mid-career workers, and so on.  As a training consultant, I join a company at longest one year, so I work almost the same as regular employees. And what I do is, of course, it depends on each project, but basically it's simple.1st; look into current situation and requirement, and analyze training needs properly2nd, Plan, design and develop appropriate, effective and efficient training,or localize global/headquarters training3rd, deliver training effectivelyThe last, review and measure the effectiveness. According to those result, change something if it's needed. It's cycle.I conduct those roles with my team. So as a project manager, I do schedule management, budget control and so on.And the one of the most important things is that I discuss or negotiate with various departments or positions, such as managers, directors, CEO, ranks of employees, and people overseas on regular conference call or business trip, to develop as much appropriate training as possible.That’s it.*--------------------* new-graduate/mid-career workersWhat do you say "新入社員" and "中途（入社）社員" in English?"新入社員" is a new employee who just graduated from Univercity/college/school."中途（入社）社員" is a new employee who worked for other company and has much experience.*That’s it.I want to say "以上です".

I work with foreign tourists and sadly I think today will be like yesterday, I mean youtube, reading some books and so on... (you might think that is fabulous specially if you get paid for doing nothing but believe me it's so boring...)But today I have some work to do, I need to write a letter to apply for a governmental grant and I can't find the moment to start it...

I work at the company which is located in the Qibao District. My home is also in the Qibao District and close to Qibao Old Street. There is only one regular bus service that goes to work. It's just two stops way but it take me about half an hour. Because of it's ten minutes' walk from home to bus station and the bus is terribly crowded and uncomfortable. Nevertheless, the company is still a ten minute walk from the bus stop. So I want to buy a bicycle. I think cycling make me independent and keep me fit. I am proud of myself that helping the environment and saving my pocket money. I prefer to walk when the weather's rainning. It's a pleasant walk, trees and flowers all the way. It take me about twenty minutes and I spend the time enjoying the peace and quiet of morning. The bus journey itself is quick, but it's a long wait for a bus. So it's actually quicker to take the whole trip on feet.

Yesterday the British Foreign Minister rejected charges of his homosexuality. The scandal was made after the publications of his photo in British media. On this picture the minister takes a walk through London with his 25 years old adviser Christopher Myerson. Also there was information that they lived together in double room during the election campaign in the parliament of May. Besides, he didn’t agree with the idea that his “special” relations with Myerson had been a reason for Christopher’s appointment, noting high qualification of ex adviser.    According to the minister Myerson is very happily married. He said he wanted to have children but his wife had had several miscarriages, and it only united their family.

He is well known for the first korean to play in the major and his fastball that gave him a nickname 'Orient express' when he debuted in 1994.He had played for 17 years in major league.  I think he made a remarkable record not only in Korean baseball history but also in Major's.

Hi there, I'll start this talking a little about me.My name is Cristian, and I live in Chile, a little country in the very end of South America, I just finished my career as a Multimedia Communicator (it's a weird title), and I'm actually working as a freelance.I'm not really interested in working for a big company, maybe if I have a good salary I'd be forced to take te job, but the life of a freelancer is priceless, Iwake up anytime, I just need to finish my work on time and try to get betterwhile learning from my mistakes, the sad part is that I don't get to go out much, my plan at first was to take my laptop and go to work at some Starbucks, the most comfy one, so I'd feel like I'm not unemployed!.But my laptop broke...Well, next payday I'll get it fixed so I can do that, it's really taking a toll to be at home for so long, I'm feeling like a hikikomori (that's a japanese term, I'm a little otakuish).That's all I can think of, if you read this and want to know more just ask me!.Thanks for reading.

There are some people in this world that seem to think that money is the most important aim in life. It is not exact.We need money to pay medicine for our mother, for our nephew or for our grandmother. With money we can buy food for homeless animals and we can save their life bringing them to veterinary, as some do often. We can also pay our fees, our aliments, and our basic needs.We can also buy some material, but spiritual goods as books, movies, songs. We can pay a ticket to go to see nice movie at cinema about love or about life. We can enjoy moving representation in theater paying the ticket for. Also, appreciate nice music at concerts when we go there. (may be also opera, but I like only the famous ones)We can as well have the chance to make some trips and visit extraordinary beautiful places in this world that will conquer our soul. We can be touched by some miracles of the wild (and not so wild) nature, and of course, meet some new, strange and probably nice persons, very different from us.But there are some curious persons in this world that seem absolutely obnubilated by money. The main reason of their lives is to have more and more money. They love drive luxe sport cars (and not one, but many), love pay expensive items and accessoiries.  They ignore persons, and ignore their family.Money is for them the only reason to live.But it is not. Reason to live can be to awake happy in room where someone comes to kiss you for good morning. To have a home where everyone shares a smile and laugh at table, where your heart feels light without reason because you have with you those that you love and that love you the most. Those that you will cry the day they have to leave forever this earth.

Do you know what the zeitgeist is? This is a term that has been used firstly in Germany by a philosopher J.G. Herder. And it has necessity of being rewritten endlessly like history because it is a kind of word that shows how we interpret that period. So you need to know the situation of the world as it is, to make your own globalized zeitgeist correctly. I also don’t want to use these words that make us (and this article) confused and completely boring. But I just want to introduce this important term and the facts that you would need for making your own values. I have known this term from watching a documentary movie named Zeitgeist that I want to tell about from now on. Here are only three introductions (somewhat changed by myself) of more in the movie.#1. – Religion.Do you believe in God or have religion? I do. But, I don’t believe church and the Bible. That is why I don’t go to church every Sunday, not because of drinking on every Saturday night. This is my own religion.  In my opinion, religions are inventions which are designed for making people in a society more clean and kind and for harmonizing them to each others. It is really good goal. But in many cases, the other goals happen. Sometimes the inventions are used for the completely opposite intentions of their infancy . For example, religions can justify horrible wars. Christianity helps this kind of wrong things to be hidden with their HOLY Bible that is a fake according to the docudrama. #2 – PossessionsWe all have to be free. But, if you feel free continuously without anything, you can even be almost enslaved . So, the thing is, to get actual freedom, we have to know more about what’s going on and have to pursue and find freedom constantly. It seems difficult. Coming to the topic, money makes us free. And also, it makes us enslaved even if we have a lot of it. That is because money is dept. The Bank doesn’t borrow money to us without profit. The docu-drama says that all the money supply on the market is always smaller than the money we have to pay back to the Bank. In other word, to pay back, some always should be bankrupt . Even if that is a story about U.S., nowadays U.S. economy is almost international thing. Who gets bankrupt? Or what nation gets?#3 – Venus projectThe docu-drama suggests and shows us a big project - building a new global society without money and oil - named Venus Project. And some people have already joined that project. They are arguing this is possible and we have that much of developed technology. The thing making it possible is technology and motivation rather than politics. I’m not worshiping this conspiracy theory  and I’m not suggesting you to join the project. I don’t know the documentary movie is true. But in the world, only 1 percent of the population owns 40 percent of the planet’s wealth. In every single day, 34,000 children die for poverty and preventable diseases. And 50 percent of the population lives with only two dollars a day. In fact, any volunteering services we can do and we do have been almost nothing or limited already. I also don’t know exactly why. But, “One thing is clear. Something is very wrong.” In the middle of this ugly moment we live in history, I think you need to have your own zeitgeist or values at least.I don’t know what I have to do also, but I’m going to do something to be someone. Because I believe I need to be somebody first to make myself do something valuable. You too, don’t waste your time, turn off TV, open your eyes to happening objective facts and find something you can do. Imagine all the people sharing all the world. Yes, it’s time to wake up to be realist, having a impossible dream in your heart, twenties!

I've been watcing that HBO TV mini-series for the last two weeks.All the time I was kept in the atmosphere of brotherhoodamong the fellas in the movie. Seing them sweating in thetraining camp, bleeding out when they were fighting on the battle field, struggling with cold in the foxholes, made me feel a deep respect to the Soldier and Human Being in general. Brave, yong, they have contributed their lifes to the country.I'm deeply moved by that movie.Actually, I watched a lot of movies about heroes and their lifes."The Pacific" is also a masterpiece. As long as the "Save Private Rian".I pray for peace in the entire world.

  I have learned Korean for about two years. Generally speaking, my Korean level can reach to middle. However, cause we only took this course once a week for only 1 hour and also cause i haven't spent a lot of time on it. My Korean just stops at "안 녕 하 세 요; 안녕히 가세요" , such kind of easy greeting sentences.  These days I am staying at home, waiting for job notice. It is non-sense to watching TV or surfing on the Internet. Thus, I decided to learn Korean by myself though it is somewhat difficult. I will try my best to learn it well. U know, I have another important reason to study Korean. Because in the last two months, I fell in love with a Korean boy. It was a nice and perfect memory. In this process, we had a large number of interesting things. Under some circumstances, when we don't want the other to understand , I would use Shanghai dialect while he would use Korean. Though i have learnt Korean before, it was still tough for me. And now this guy has already said byebye to me and went back to Busan. He promised that he would never go to Shanghai except travelling. In order to commemorate my "first love", I'm sure that I will exert all my energies to Korean.  Maybe some day we will come together again, at that time I will make him feel surprise for my Korean.   Last night I successfully typed my first Korean word" 허 일 우"on computer. It was interesting.kkkk...  화이팅!

Hey everybody!Well, my name's Lisa, I'm 17 years old and I live in France, most precisely in the north, where the weather is awful everyday and where the rain became our friend!I'm someone who really enjoys languages. Currently I'm learning english and spanish... I used to learn Italian but I stopped because I was always mistaking between Italian and Spanish... I'd like to learn German but for the moment, I prefer to acquire good levels in both languages before learning German. If I could, I would learn each language but my free time doesn't help me with doing that... About my everyday life, I'm a student and so I go to school every day! I admit that sometimes I'd prefer staying home, laying in my bed! Maybe that's because I like to think about everything and those moments help me to escape life's reality which hurts sometimes... I don't know :)About my hobbies, well I like doing sport, listening to music (of course, what would we be without it ??), mhh watching great films, especially at the cinema... I also enjoy going out with my friends. They're very nice and I have wonderful time with them! And finaly, I love to be with my family!In my life as a teenager, I'm accustomed to little problems... School, boys, friendships... Well, there are some things I can't handle! I try to be as mature as I can, because I'm someone who thinks a lot about the future.. Well I don't want to destroy my life ! So even if it is quite hard sometimes, I keep it to myself, I try to find out what my problems are and then everything goes on much better :)Later, I would like to work as a conceptrice-writer, in publicity. I don't know the name of the job I want to do, but in a nutshell, a person who does that job finds ideas to create the commercial! He finds the topic and the slogan.So, to end me introduction, I really hope meeting nice people here. Thank you for your help, and don't hesitate if you have any problems with your french :)

Thi is going to be the first time that I write in lang-8. And I want so tell about my life in Japan.What is the reason that I am here, in Japan?This is my history.In 2009 I was living in Toronto studying english. And I was doing something else, my best hobby. Almost every day I used to go dancing salsa.And, one night I saw somebody and she was dancing very nice. I wanted to dance with her. So, I decided and I asked her "do you wanna dance". Usually couples only dance one song but with her (her name is Miwa), we danced almost seven o maybe more. That was very special.And? Well, Miwa is from Japan and she went to Toronto for one week for vacation, and specially for dancing salsa. Tha was my best week in Toronto, we spent fantastic, terrific time together, altought the weather was very cold. That happened at the first week of dicember of 2009.When she went back to Japan and me to Mexico, we kept contact by messenger. Almost every day we were chantting. We didn`t know what is gonna happend between us. One day she said " I want to go to Mexico". And she really did it. We spent another two wonderfulls weeks together. We were traveling in a car around Mexico. We visited Guanajuato, Paztcuaro, Morelia, Uruapan and others cityies. I need to go. I will finish this in the afternoon.

Such a sad story... But I really liked it. It's a love story with a girl who has leukemia.Actors are the same than in "Byakuyakou", that I also liked very much.

This exposition was devoted to Salvador Dali, I never have seen his painting in the museum untill this moment. And I have knew  a littel about him. I was surprised his creativity. It's wonderfully, It's astonishingly. In his paintings there are many colours, there are many interesting ideas. Especially I have liked the series of his paintings about The deadly sins. In next weekend  I am going to go once more to this exposition, because in next Sunday there will be lecture about his life.

RioAn interesting movie has a very simple story line. It's easy to follow and enjoy it. Giving the animals man-like behaviors is the part I love most. It's hard to believe they make so many man's face in a dog or bird. But they did it. Some idea surprised me so much. Especial the idea the dog helps them to cut the chain. I just confused how can the editors thought out such a brilliant idea. I am very sure there must be a idea tank. They save the idea when it flash in their mind. If they can use them in a single movie, they can leave it for the next one.I believe even a great writer can not image a story totally isolate for the reality world. Based on such viewpoint, I always moving by such movie which show us the good side of human-being. Without the friends' help, Blue absolutely can not achieve such a happy live with the girl he loves. Best wishes for the couples who love each other so much.

Insanity is everywhere!My junkie junky neighbour has taken to urinating outside my door. It seems that giving beatings to his wife does not suffice anymore.I wonder What his snobby mother thinks of such behaviour. Do you think she would say 'hey! How tender! Look at my crack addicted, coward, women beating son! He has found another way to show how disturbed he has become because of his father´s cheating on me with his secretary, and our failing to show him any affection'?Well I guess that's what daily life is supposed to be on the skidrow, or, better yet, that's what 'royal' eccentricity is like. I guess my nextdoor neighbour is just peculiar. Or maybe crack has just already distroyed his brain. No way of figuring it out.How harsh it is a midleclass mummy's child's daily drama of life! How much life owes you! But life will make up for such injustice by letting you have as much crack as your parents' money can afford, regardless whether they, at last, have to sell their last and most precious possession.Who would have ever thought that pampering might turn an innocent child into such an addicted violent 37 year-old baby. But there is nothing to worry about as long as you walk among people priding yourself on having done such a good work bringing up such a gracious child. Whatever the case is it, the wierdo mind is a puzzle which not even his mother is willing to solve. Anyway, no matter how wicked you are, sun rises again every day.I would even dare to say that women might find this behavior appealing since he managed to get himself a wife. She also doesn't seem to mind his beating her. Not to mention that she gave birth to a child of him. I know! if you put it into perspective, it sounds like a recipe for love. Nothing like sheer violence and nonsense to turn somebody on.Well see you around with more stories from the ghetto. Reality is always much more shocking than fiction! You see? Hey! wait a second! I guess I'm being unjust. I must grant him that he has the courage to get up every single day. How strong is the call of life in this God's creature.

Hello everybody,A few days ago, I've discovered something pretty awesome: it is called penmanship.It could be decribed as the art of writing. After much practice, the results are really great.I'd like to acquire this skill, however it doesn't really fit into my schedule right now. I'm still practicing a little bit every day.Well, I'll attend my exam within 8 weeks and a few days, but I've still many things to learn. That's what we call a challenge, so I find it quite interesting.By the way, I also keep a daily journal from sunday. That way I could keep a handwritten record of my days. It's always interesting to see change occure.I'd also like to tell to every japanese people to keep faith and stay optimistic during this crisis period.Have an interesting day.N.A.

This morning, I wake up in a bad mood. I've caught a nasty cold. Outside, the rain is falling. This night I will not go  out to celebrate New Year.I'm looking for a penfriend since two weeks. It's difficult to find someone who want to correct you.I take once again my computer. I MUST find a way to improve my English. Wonderful ! Lang-8 ! It's just what I need. People who want to help and I can help them.I see no longer the rain falling. What about New Year in my land ?Many people go out to celebrate this day. They enjoy to have a good meal with hepar adiposum, oyster, champagne and so on.They enjoy to go here and there to dance.Midnight is the hour to kiss everybody and to wish a happy new year.Everybody throws confetti to other people.The party has to go on till the morning. Then people go together to have breakfast. They go back home and have a little rest because the first January is the day you have to visit parents. They are so kind! They cooked for you a marvellous meal with a lot of dishes ! But your head is broken and you don't want anything but your bed. You have to smile and to say thanks a lot. But you're happy to know that many people love you.

I don't really know how to start it... Anyway, I'm Russian, I'm a total nerd and I'm not used to meeting new people, online or in 'real' life. I'm interested in learning foreign languages - only my German still sucks. Also I've just started learning Hebrew and Latvian.A few of the (random) things I'm interested in: Soviet cinematography, post-punk music, Superhero movies, Malcolm McDowell, Stanley Kubrick, Luchino Visconti, Fritz Lang, silent movies, zombies, Gothic Lolita fashion, Jane Austen, Choderlos De Laclos, Akutagawa Ryunosuke, Anton Chekhov, Joseph Brodsky (I actually read to much, as I'm a literature major. There are way too many authors that I like).Oh, I also have to admit that I watch The X-Files every day.

 I learned Japanese as my major in the University.Though I passed CET-4 and CET-6,I can't write and speak much in English.Frankly,I regret having not study English hard in the University.I studied English from the middle school,and I was really interested in it.Because I have to prepare the Intenational Japanese test 1st grade,maybe it's not correct.I paid my all attention after I passed the CET-6,and learned nothing about English.After gratuating from the University,I started to work  in this company until now.My work is not busy,so I want to learn something that maybe help me when I want to change my work.Write these things in English is really difficult to me,but I won't give up.I think one of the reasons is that the difference between Japanese and English is too much,sometimes I can't make quick reaction,for example,grammar and so on.Now,after the company,I read something both in English and Japanese,and I hope I can master both of them.Certainly,I have to work hard.

I've been surfing on this site for a week and I really think that it's a great site to improve English, (in my case) or any language. People is very kind and they correct your entries in few min. You can made friends and learn about other cultures too. What's the bad point? You can practise listening or speaking. And sometimes native speakers only correct grammar mistakes so although your text is technically correct it don't seem to be real English.

Hi, I am brook from korea.English always has been a daunting challenge for me since I was little. Since I was born and raised in korea where fluent english skill is necessary for success and everyone seems to be crazy about learning english, I was forced to study english hard like other korean students.Thanks to those years spent learning English, now my english is okay, I guess. I am quite good at reading and listening so i enjoy reading books written in english, often listening news in english. But the problem is speaking and writing. The 'English'I learn from school and other private institutions didn't make me speak or write in english well. I often find myself having difficulty in expressing my own thoughts and feeling in english. How frustrating it is...I tried to write something(like book reviews)in english on some websites, but I was so ashamed of my english that I just coulnd't. And then, I find this site!It's for learners, so there's no reason i should be ashamed of my poor english!And plus, maybe some kind people will correct wrong sentences or grammatical error. how cool!Anyway i am so glad to find this site and hope my english can be improved.

The problem of child’s development is very important today. The main reason of this problem is accelerated life rhythm. Adults do not have enough time for their kids and this fact means that children feel lack of parents’ attention and care.On the one hand, parents are have the general role in children’ life because every child spend lots of time with his relatives. When somebody communicate with another person for a long time it plays important role in development of person’s character.  On the other hand, present life rhythm is much more accelerated than in the past. It means that parents have no choice and they stay his child (or children)  with nannies, classmates and so forth. These persons are very important part of children’ development on different life stages. For example, your classmates’ habits can became your. We talk about both types of habits: useful and unuseful (smoking and such). Thirdly, each of contemporary mass media is very effective in entertainment and informing people. But people can become addicted of these thins. One of significant today’s problems is the Internet addiction. Children spend lots of time in the network but they do not do any useful business. They just waste their time or/and money. I want to say that we have to find ways for right developing children. Cause - they are a new generation, a future and we have to think about our future and perspectives of our society. We should develop some labour laws for protecting people with kids. We must create new methods of controlling content and interaction in the Internet for eliminating the “network-addiction” syndrome.

If you will sleep again till the night we will fish fell on ourselves a night wind cold. - Well, same it is good - not-standard. – answered I having turned over on one side.After 30 minutes I was in the car filled with fishing accessories.

Hi everyone;I'm just getting used to the new office environment including people...(including disregarding what I don't want to get involved in)Only current foes that attack me are... sweets.I'm supposed to improve my English here but...sweats get in my way!!My office has "Office Glico" ...kind of okashi (sweets and not sweets alike) delivery service to the offices probably within Tokyo.Each product sells at 100 JPY.It doesn't have good range of sweets, rather goes the opposite...even though they change the selection once a week.But I end up grabbing one or two of them after struggling with my craving for sweats. Every day.It should add up to a lot of amount of money!Honestly, I think I'm sort of getting bored again here (I'm tired of saying the same thing since my previous job). But I don't want to make it a lame excuse for my health and finances!!However, still thanks to God, I have freedom to write this here instead of focusing on the sweets temptation...But seriously...anyone who has a good idea to fight against this!?!

Dear friends, I need your help!I'am preparing the introduction for my term paper at British history. But i am afraid that i have a lot of mistakes.. %))Here it is:The History of England is very profound and many-sided. It totals a huge number of events and the persons, who anyhow influenced it. In each epoch there were key moments and figures about which it is possible to read a lot of the interesting.I consider that one of the most ambiguous figures of English history is the representative of the Tudor dynasty,  daughter of king Henry VII  - Maria the First or as she is also named -  Bloody Mary. This name is still shrouded by set of secrets and legends. There are no monuments put in her homeland, people associate the period of her reign with bloody massacres; day of her death (and simultaneously day of accession to the throne Elizabeth I) was marked in the country as a national holiday. We see the picture gloomy enough, but it has involved me in this historic figure. Having read about the queen at a history lesson, I have started to search for the every possible information about her, to read various books, to see the films connected with her personality. When I have looked an English serial "Tudors", about this great dynasty, I became assured that my term paper will be about Maria. I wanted to learn more about this strange, fanatical queen who has doomed to death a large quantity innocent people.In my work I have tried to track Maria's life from a birth, to the death.I have collected every possible legends connected with her and the facts of her biography which prove that this person was historical and that it is noteworthy.
