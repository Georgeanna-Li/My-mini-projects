I would like to speech a little about music that I love.Because I love too many music, today I will only talk a little about French music.My favourite French band is Noir Désir.The band was created in 80s but they have been known a large success (only in France) only ten year ago with a rock album. The singer of the band is Bertrand Cantat. The lyrics of many songs are very important because they are poetic or politically committed. The band militate against globalization and fascism. For example, the song "Un jour en France" (a day in France) is a song against extreme right and especially the National Front wich is a French far-right and nationalist political party. Here is two amongst lot of beautiful musics : "le vent l'emportera" (with translation of lyrics in the description of the video) and "à ton étoile".







For those who prefer rock music, I highly recommend "Un jour en France", "Comme elle vient", "Tostaky" and "L'homme pressé". My favourite French musician is Yann Tiersen. Maybe you have already hear about him because he composed and played Amelie original sound tracks.Monochome (lyrics are in english, so enjoy !):

This the summary of my internship report, could you please correct if anything is wrong please ? Thank you^^I have always been interested by the publishing companies so I decided to search for an internship in this field. I began to search in the manga publishing companies because that way I would be able to use my Japanese skills during my internship. I contacted several publishing companies and Taïfu Comics Publishing was ready to take me as an intern in their company.So my internship began at Taïfu Comics on the 2nd of November 2010 and lasted four months. The head office was situated at the 16th of Christophe Colomb Street in Sucy en Brie. My internship supervisors were Yves Huchez and his wife Véronique Huchez. They both explained to me the publishing process of mangas and the way the company was functioning.During my internship I had several missions, the main one was the proofreading of the translations of the mangas we received from the freelance translators that the company employed. I had to make sure that there were no grammatical or spelling mistakes and that the style was not too formal and that it matches the aimed audience. I also had to scan the mangas and to pass the files on to the computer graphics specialist. I was also in charge of regularly updating the website of the company. I had to create quizzes and write special features on several manga and post them on the website to keep the readers interested. Another of my tasks was to do some research on Japanese magazines to see what is the last chapter published in Japan for the mangas the company is currently publishing and to find if the authors of manga the company already published have written new mangas that could be interesting to publish in France. I also had to write press-cards containing information such as the title, the author, the genre and the summary of a manga. Those press-cards were given to the booksellers to help them know where to put the manga and how to organize them. Another of my missions was to prepare the mangas for the conventions on Japanese popular culture that Taïfu Comics is participating in.My internship finished on the 28th of February 2011. I am really grateful that Taïfu Comics Publishing took me as an intern. I feel that this was truly a great experience, rewarding from both the personal and professional points of view.

These days I have to take my English course at every Tuesday and Thursday nights. This course is offered by the local women's center. The manager and receptionists at the center are very friendly. My English teacher is a middle-age woman who can speak 3 languages - French, Russian and English. And there are 6 classmates in my class. At the beginning of this term, I would like to go there for a conversation course, but they arranged me to learn in another course concentrating on grammars.My teacher is great. My classmates are great too. I made some friends there. One thing makes me crazy is that all of them can speak French except me. So if one of them can't express something appropriately in English, they convert to speak in French.Anyway, I like learning English with other people together. I'll introduce my classmates one by one next time.This is my first diary on this website. Thank you!

Some of us think that it is better to see the films than to read the books in the original. Because students can save plenty of time learning about the story by watching films. It is really a kind of concentrate that can improve our efficiency on study. Also, there are a lot of interesting characters and fantastic scenes in the movies. And it will be easy for us to understand the story.On the other hand, there are quite a few advantages in reading books in the original, too. We can get more details in the book and can appreciate the emotional expressions from the author more deeply. In addition, the vivid descriptions in the books are pretty attractive to readers.Personally speaking, both the film and the book in the original are good for our cultivation. They are able to help us broaden our horizons. And we can obtain a lot of knowledge from them!

Hello everyone, my name is Felipe but my friends call me "pipe",although I'm Chilean/Indonesian, I only speak Spanish.The reason why I singed up is that I need to drastically improvemy English skills within the next two weeks (I wish I had paid moreattention to it when I was in high school, but at that time I was avery lazy student and honestly, I never thought that I'd ever needit, what an irony!). Yes, I know it may sound like an impossibletask, but as they say: "Hope is the last thing you loose". So hereI am, asking for some helpI've been learning English by myself, mostly through Internet andlately I've been reading a book called "Life with The Taylors" thatI found while I was scrutinizing my father's stuff. The book is kindof old, if I'm not mistaken, it was printed in 1960.The funny thing is that I can only read/write in English but I'm notable to speak it. I don't know how I'm going to take that Englishoral test :(.By the way, if you need help improving your Spanish, or learning it,you can always count on me. You can find me on facebook, MSN, or justwrite me an e-mail at this e-mail: address: pipe.gaetan@hotmail.comAnyway, any correction pointed out would be very appreciated.Thanks in advance.-pipechao chau :3!

My name is Misael and my article is about pulque, which is a traditional beverage from my country.The Aztecs considered the pulque as the drink of the gods, and it was once very common to find people who sold it.Today it exists in many different flavors such as oatmeal, pineapple or cactus fruit.Although some people often find the consistency of pulque to be daft, I think it is really such a delicious and cool beverageit is relatively cheap and sold in pulcatas (pulcatas is the place where the people sell pulque). Mexico City is very famous for places such as "La risa" or "La hija de los Apaches."Apart from being a beverage, it's also used in many dishes or sauces as a main ingredient.

When there was a rush of construction work during the period of prosperity, you could see many foreigners working at such sites. However, UK as well as another country suffers a shakeout now, threfore it is very difficult for these foreigner to have a job. Most of them have already returned and those who still stay in London are also anxious for whether they secure their job or not....Lang-8 friend, if you read my diary, please tell me current status.

(note : Tomoya is a boy)Let's recapitulate : Tomoya's mother dies in his early childhood. His dreams of being a basketball player are shattered by his father who accidentally breaks his shoulder. Then, Tomoya's father, full of angst, drinks and wastes his money at gambling. Then Tomoya marries Nagisa, sees her dying by childbirth at home while a snow tempest blows outside. Then he leaves his daughter Ushio to her grandparents until he wakes up five years later and takes her back from them so they can finally cry for their daughter. And finally, Ushio, who was pretty healthy until then, suddenly becomes ill and dies in the street in his father's arms (under the snow, of course). At this rate, a third season of Clannad might feature :- the Furukawas' bakery burning down to the ground (with them in it)- a major earthquake crumbling down the whole city while Tomoya is hunting starfishes at the beach- and end with a homeless and drunk Tomoya dying, eaten alive by boars. And more snow.

*Hi everyone, this is the first part of my cover letter in english to successfully find a new job here in japan!! thank you very much!!* "Giving everything to find solutions" - From my work in a consulting company, I learned that, instead of waiting for an answer that won’t come, I should always adopt a positive attitude when facing a problem or an incertitude. I won’t give up before I try all the possibilities. For example, in the case of a sample research on the Internet, if I cannot find appropriate material in Japanese language websites, I will enlarge my research scope to another language, another country or by digging in forums and local bbs. If I’m not able to find a solution by myself, I won’t be shy seeking the help of my colleagues and eventually of outsourcing relatives. In my past position in an Architecture and Construction company, employees from different sections were often working together. On a river water park project, for example, specialists from city planning group, landscape design group, and hydraulics management group were gathering and made a creative synergy. Therefore I’m convinced that I’m comfortable with this network working process which defines modern companies. Reciprocally, I adopt the positive attitude of letting everyone know about my capacities and knowledge (for example speaking French, knowing about French laws, etc), and that I would be pleased to help, in order to find solutions. In brief, it’s all about a “Give and take” process of cooperation between employees, for the benefit of the whole company.

I will probably be nervous at the beginning of the presentation. That’s because I am involved in a recruiting process in order to get a job. The process is very advanced. I know that the company wants to hire me, and also I want to work at the company... But there is a last challenge: I need to demonstrate an acceptable English level.Believe me, that’s a unique opportunity for me at this moment of my career. After 11 years working in Financial Companies , I’m moving to an insurance company.As you know, we are in the middle of a big financial crisis. These are very difficult times in financial institutions, and my company is involved in a merging process. In that scenario, the core business will be located in Madrid, and the human resources department is asking to me if I want to go to Madrid.I’m open to listen proposals, but I have a 2 years old child and my wife has a stable work here, so moving to Madrid is quite complicated. In this situation, the real possibility to still working in Barcelona is exciting.My wife works in a Technological Centre, she is in charge to manage part of the Spanish government funds to promote investigation and environmental research.

I'm excited to start!Well, now that I have started I need something to write. Was there something funny today?? Mmm..okay, I will just write what I did today for now.I went to the Gym after work to take an earobics lesson. It was my first time to take the instructors lessen and was kind of nervous. She started with some easy steps and it made me relieved. But at the end I was completely disappointed by myself. She introduced 4 counts for steps and 3 counts for hands and we needed to move them together and I couldn't mange it at all!!(Mmmm ..I am not sure if I'm making some sense. but it's okay, move on)After taking shower, I tried to meet my husband at the station and take the same city bus to home by reaching him with mobile but he did not answer so I thought he was working over time. I got on the bus by myself and got home.When I was going to unlock the key, the door opened and my husband was waiting for me inside."You scared me!!" I said.Thank you for reading!!!

Hi, these are my answers about three questions I was asked. Thanks for your help.1)	There are several Science fiction subgenres; they can be divided into five parts. The first one is the Speculative fiction, which happens in a future world with problems about ethics or racism between humans and a technological advanced being. For example, in Gatacca, Andrew Niccol’s movie, Jerome, a natural human, try to go in space whereas it is reserved for perfect beings. Then, we have the Space opera which takes place in a whole universe, on an interplanetary scale with a lot of species and languages. Star Wars was the first space opera movie but the creator of this subgenre is Isaac Asimov. The next one is (for many, would I say the next ones are?) the Hard science like The Space Odyssey, an Arthur C. Clark’s novel. The Political allegory is another subgenre; George Orwell’s 1984 belongs to it. The last one is the Heroic Fantasy with for example the movie Doomsday.2)	The story of Robots is formed from two times. Before the 60s, robots were seen as a help for humanity, People had a positive view about them. Their rights were restricted by the three Asimov’s laws which defined how a robot must act with a human. Since 60s or 70s, robots have had feelings. They haven’t been necessary good anymore and have even sometimes gotten insane. These modifications have changed the popular idea about robots and they have become devil because they have stolen many jobs.3)	I’d say Frankenstein is a science fiction novel that I’d put in speculative fiction because it’s especially focused on the relationship between Victor, the creator and the monster. Moreover, another main theme is about the exclusion of Frankenstein from the world because he’s different –actually he has a perfect mind but an ugly appearance-. So he gets to hate people and particularly his creator. The decor isn’t the part the most worked but anyway, the novel seems to be a science fiction one because Frankenstein is a creature created by science. Nevertheless, Mary Shelly wrote the work in 1818 so it’s rather a precursory than a real science fiction book.

Hello everyone! This is my first post over here, so all advice are appreciated! It is written as a short dialog.---Ordinary work say, hall of an everage business company. - Hey Dave! - Oh, Mike, hi! How're you?- Fine, fine, everything's ok... Listen, what do you think (do you mind?) if I take time off the day after tomorrow?- Yes, of course, why not? But don't forget about meeting at 13:00 in the meeting room. Some very important issues will be brough up there (on/at the meeting?), so I'm hope you'll help me manage them (all?). Oh, and one more thing: you should hand in by end of the day the report I told you (about?) last week.- Yes, sure, I remember about all (the? these?) things. Sorry, I'm in a hurry, do you want to talk over something else or...?- No, no, you may go! See you at the meeting!- See you!---Thank in advance for every correction!

Hello world! I am preparing my internship in an alternative lifestyle magazine and have to build a portfolio of articles and interviews. Here you have some questions I am gonna ask in my firts interview to an absolutely great and inspiring tattoo artist. any help would be wonderful! I have read in many of your interviews that you define tattooing as “just a job”. Actually, the attitude of most of the tattooists is that they are deities in an exclusive club formed only by a few crew of lucky chosen ones. Have you ever felt that tattooing was the center of your existence, the most important thing in your life? ¿Have you ever felt that sensación of being a “lucky one” because of your job as a tattoo artist, or you have always seen it just like another job?  You are considered a brilliant tattooist, but you also have some fame of being quite “difficult”. Assuming that you do not pretend and that is just the way you are;  did that difference made harder to acquire a reputation in the tattoo world or, on the contrary, you think that you would not have been able to become what you are nowadays without it? Revisiting the point of “what does tattooing means”, ¿do you consider tattoos as a form of art? ¿What kind of real personal expression is possible in a tattoo? You do not do any tattoo you don’t really like or want to do, so, ¿How much can we know about you tough your work? Speaking of influences, when a tattooist is asked, generally talks about another colleagues’ work. However, in your case, I guess that is not so simple. Which are your most destacables external influences for your work?  Finalizing, it is unavoidable to notice your connection with all related with another time, another era: your antiques collection, your past interest with Native Americans or your studio itself Elf ¿When did it all begun? ¿Is that a way to show some kind of unconformity with the days we are living? ¿Can you remember when did you exactly started collecting antiques or you have us grown with it?

hello~ nice to meet you all of you!Can I ask you something here?Well, these days i'm taking the religion class which teach about the bible in english. and we're going to discuss about some below questions.So, does anyone give me the model answers?First, the text which we're going to discuss is the part of the bible like this...Luke 1:46-80, 2:1-20(I'm so sorry it's too long.)Mary's Song  46And Mary said:    "My soul glorifies the Lord     47and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,  48for he has been mindful       of the humble state of his servant.    From now on all generations will call me blessed,     49for the Mighty One has done great things for me—       holy is his name.  50His mercy extends to those who fear him,       from generation to generation.  51He has performed mighty deeds with his arm;       he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.  52He has brought down rulers from their thrones       but has lifted up the humble.  53He has filled the hungry with good things       but has sent the rich away empty.  54He has helped his servant Israel,       remembering to be merciful  55to Abraham and his descendants forever,       even as he said to our fathers."  56Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home. The Birth of John the Baptist  57When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son. 58Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.  59On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah, 60but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John."  61They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."  62Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child. 63He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John." 64Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak, praising God. 65The neighbors were all filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things. 66Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him. Zechariah's Song  67His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:  68"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,       because he has come and has redeemed his people.  69He has raised up a horn[d] of salvation for us       in the house of his servant David  70(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),  71salvation from our enemies       and from the hand of all who hate us—  72to show mercy to our fathers       and to remember his holy covenant,  73the oath he swore to our father Abraham:  74to rescue us from the hand of our enemies,       and to enable us to serve him without fear  75in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.  76And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;       for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,  77to give his people the knowledge of salvation       through the forgiveness of their sins,  78because of the tender mercy of our God,       by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven  79to shine on those living in darkness       and in the shadow of death,    to guide our feet into the path of peace."  80And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the desert until he appeared publicly to Israel.Luke 2The Birth of Jesus  1In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. 2(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) 3And everyone went to his own town to register.  4So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. 5He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. 6While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, 7and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. The Shepherds and the Angels  8And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. 9An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 10But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. 11Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ[a] the Lord. 12This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."  13Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,  14"Glory to God in the highest,       and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests."  15When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."  16So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. 17When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 18and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 19But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 20The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told. and finally these are the discussion questions...1. review Mary's song, what does her words say about her?2. Zachariah said in verse 69 that 'God was sending salvation from the enemies and those who hated them; did he have a clear understanding of John and Jesus' mission?3. Luke 1:66 says that the Lord was with John. Does that mean that John would be successful, healthy, smart etc.? explain.4. In your opinion, what is success?5. Is it possible to be successful and not be rich or powerful? explain.I'm sure I'm just not going to copy your model answers. I'm just..I'm not good at english. So please help me...ㅜㅜAnyway have a nice day and thank you~~

I translated some of the dragon tales in Chinese mythology these days. Limited to personal level, mistake can’t be avoided. Please correct. Thanks!The Defeated Dragon KingLong time ago, there was an old fish man whose family name was Shen lived in Shen Jiamen which was only a desolate hill at that time. The old fish man made a scanty living to feed his wife and daughter by fishing every day.One day the old fish man went to the sea by his boat. He casted his net to the sea several times but he got nothing. As it got darker and the wind also became stronger the old fish man knew that he’d better go back right now or else he might encounter danger. But he hesitated as he knew his whole family was waiting for him hungrily. At the time when he felt awkward he saw a flock of seabirds flying over nearby. He knew “where there are the seabirds, there are schools of fish” from his years of fishing experiences. The old fish man hurried to cast his net there but he got nothing still. He felt frustrated and decided to go back home. Suddenly he found something glowing in his net. He pulled it out and learnt that it was a nicely carven seal made of jade. There was a splendid gold dragon coiling the seal with an extremely bright pearl in its mouth and also some unreadable curving characters. Oddly enough, with the glow of the pearl the sea unexpectedly became calm and the boat sailed steadily also. Ah! The seal was a treasure! With this thought the old fish man kept the seal into his purse and went back home happily.

It always killed me that I will never speak English as a native speaker. All these verbs & fraseology. Every time I speak, I slip somewhere and a real-English-person can see it. When I go in the street & slip & fall & somebody sees it I get this inconvenient feeling. On the other hand, practice is the only difference between me & that imaginary native speaker. If I'm consistant, I'll slip not so often. And even seldom. One day :)Hope you'll help me in the process!

Today's topic is "Do you prefer learning by yourself to learning with a teacher?":::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: In my opinion most of people prefer learning with a teacher rather than learning by themselves. For example, when you go to primary school, junior high school or high school there must be a teacher and a teacher teach some subjects for students. Thus It is no doubt most of people think learning from a teacher is common. Besides, it is true when you learn some difficult thing, for instance, math or science studying by yourself is very hard and learning from a teacher is the easiest things. However, from my experience I forgot most of a things which I learned from my teacher because thanks to my good teacher he taught me so easily so I just understood on that time. Therefore, from this reason I prefer learning by myself. I will write some advantages of learning by myself as follows. First of all, you can memorize for a log time compare with learning from a teacher. For example, when I tied to study for a university entrance exam I  learned some english vocabulary or the famous history person's name by heart everyday. Unlike learning easily from a teacher I had to write many time on paper to memorize and it also need patience. Thanks to this studying I can remember most of part now. Next is that you can study for own pace. If you teach from teacher you have to preparation which you will do next day so that you don't afford to study what you want to do. However, learning by yourself you don't need preparation and you can feel relax to study. Of course, you can make your own schedule and do as you want to study. Therefore, learning  by yourself is the most efficient way to study.

It irritates me, but I can`t do nothing with it.I do like some new experiences in my life, so I went in the English speaker`s club for the first time, to hear my friends speach. There were lots of people and I was scared that someone will want me to make a self presentation, but it didn`t happened. Than, after this, I drank vine with my friends and, also, we were watching the film"Wristcutters". It`s nice, but ... well.. I do such things every day. Something new, what doesn`t look so, than the same. That`s the problem, but it`s ok.Now I`m studying English and French, I hope to be a translator, not an enterpreter, you know, I do not like this, but the written translation it`s the thing I`ll like I guess.

I recently moved to the new place, which is....next door!!Because the house has extra huge two windows, the room is so bright! Since the moving house is so painful and stressful in Japan, at first, I was unwilling to move to the next door, and Internet says "You might have to pay key money again. Some landlord is reluctant to allow you to move the next door."..... But, finally I called landlord and I got the next door's key in one hour, and didn't have to pay anything! How easy was that! Now, I am so happy, If you want to move to a different room in the same flat, you should ask landlord anyway. They might let you move easily!

(This is a summary of notes for prepare me to civilization test on January. My problems aren't the knowledge but my English expression :/ )After the break up of Soviet Union, Canada became the largest nation in the world.Canada is a federation composed by three territories (Northwest, Nunavut and Yukon) and ten provinces (most famous are Ontario and Quebec for example). Provinces receive their power from the Constitution Act to 1867 and territories receive their power from federal government.Canada resources are mainly woods, potatoes and fair trade, but this last years oil support the economy in Alberta, uranium in Saskatchewan, gold and nickel in Manitoba.In 1999 it’s the creation of the Nunavut “our land” in Inuktitut language. This land is given to them for apologize the destruction to their land and clans by the settlers. After the WW1, many people arrived in Canada but the great depression of the 70s and the WW2 stopped immigration for a while. In 60s a lot of Asians came, and it’s the beginning of race difficulties. In 1971, the government of Pierre Trudeau officialized the multiculturalism policy. They established a government department to promote the multicultural character. When the law became colour blind, more immigrants from Asia and third world country than Europe.The construction of Canada began with the discovery of New France (Quebec).Jacques Cartier wanted to find gold, ordered to find a passage to India “the north-west passage”. He discovered the entrance of the St Lawrence River and found Montreal during 2nd expedition. Samuel Champlain established the first French foot-board in 1608. But few immigrants came.In 1754 it was the beginning of the territory war called “the seven years war” or “the French and Indian war”. The war finished in 1763, with the treaty of Versailles: France gave up its colonies to the British.In 1774, American wanted Canada against British, but Quebec refused to join the revolution. In 1794, British recognised the independence of the 13 colonies, but kept Canada. But, after the independence, a lot of American people moved to Canada, and New Brunswick was founded.After the Constitutional Act of 1791, the territory was divided between Lower Canada (Quebec) with mainly French area, and Upper Canada (Ontario), mainly English area. In 1867, British parliament pasted the British North America act with brought the Canada as a nation. The new nation needed a new capital and Ottawa was chosen by the Queen Victoria because it was between Ontario and Quebec.

Today, at Japanese class, she came and asked me about giving her a Bridget Jones's Diary questionnaire (our English teacher told us to read it). And then, she told me to have lunch together. I told her it was OK, and asked her where we were having dinner (what a strange sentence o_O). She said "at my home". I was really happy!!At two o'clock I went to her home. Her flatmates were at the lounge-dining-room. The three girls were all with their own laptops. My friend told us me to have a seat, but I didn't want to. I couldn't just wait since I was quite nervous. She prepared really delicious dishes. I want to learn cooking that meals. But I was a little bit embarrassed. Her three flatmates were there, with their laptops, and I was also there, with my friend, eating. Also, we didn't have much to talk about.But I was so happy to be invited to her home and was able to eat Korean dishes. I'm happy!! By the way, I have to invite her some day...

During all the 19th century and later, numerous immigrants have rushed to the USA. They all trusted in the following belief : the American dream.The American dream is the idea that consists of thinking that anybody can easily become rich with nothing but hard work in America. Indeed, the fact that someone gets all benefits of his work is part of the liberal economic politic of the USA.So that, it is possible to completely enjoy the Amrican way of life.By the way, this point is the main reason that makes immigrants leave their country. In fact, they try to improve their condition by working in America. Because of that, the USA are usually considered as an "Eldorado".The phenomenon began as some people actually made their way from nothing. For instance, Andrew Carnegie ended up becoming a man of influence in the midst of the steel industry during the 19th century whereas he began as a mere worker in a textile factory.

<<Hello. I am translating from Japanese to English (my mother tongue.. Spanish :O). Can you give me a hand here? This is a TEAM B website greeting, by the leader. He used to be part of TEAM A, and that`s pretty much what the first half is about, and then he moved and started the new TEAM B.Eisa is a type of okinawan dance were they use taiko drums.>>GreetingLeader's GreetingMy first encounter with the Eisa was back in summer of 2003, when I watched a TEAM A Tokyo Chapter performance for the first time.Under the blazing sun, the group performed with such an intensity that overwhelmed me, and from that day onwards I became a regular spectator of their performances.The following year, I was accepted as a member, and along with the everyday practices I had the chance to stand (appear/ perform?) in many different events and festivals.In 2008, I became Sub-Leader and took the responsibility of transferring everything the older members of the team had tough us to the next generation. I hold dear many precious memories of my experience there.From now on, as leader of TEAM B, I strive to making the most out of my experience in TEAM A and taking it to the next level. My goal is to grow (raise?) a group whose performances can move and impress everyone watching.The formation of TEAM B could not have been possible without the support and aid of many people, which I am most thankful to. Also, as regards to the kindness and warmth we receive from the people who come to see our performances we cannot possibly put our appreciation into words, but instead, into every beat of the Taiko drum we hold, and into every step of our dances, with all of our might (we thank you?).<<This last paragraph may need a lot of work, am I using the word perform too much? I cannot find a suitable synonym. Thank you!!!!>>

Today was a normal day, just a little bit more exhausting. I think the main reason is that I couldn't sleep more than 4 hours and I need at least 9. The school was fine because I were all day fooling around with a friend and we didn't do anything at all in the whole day.  After school I went to my violin class and played "Melodia en La" by Astor Piazzolla with my teacher, who plays the cello beautifully. It was really cool.  Now I'm listening a really great album called "The 5000 Spirits Or The Layers Of The Onion". The Incredible String Band is awesome.  Today I think I'll go to bed earlier and try to get some sleep.

Hi My real name is Claudia and I'm a 20-year-old chilean translation student. A friend in my university recommended me this website, and it seems really helpful. I think it's a nice thing to help and to be helped, so I'll be around as much as I can.As said before, I'm a translation student, and I'm in my 3rd year. My mother tongue is Spanish and the languages I'm currently studying are both English and Japanese. I'm a former student of Portuguese (which I studied for 2 years) and German (only one semester), but I really want to keep learning these two in a near future, along with the ones I'm right now.I'll be super glad to help whenever I can!Japanese entries coming soon ;) since I think I'll really need help there xD.

I found something quite interesting on the internet today. A video of the animated series of Marvel Super Heroes. A chapter of the adventures of Mighty Thor.I remember have seen it before, when I was a kid.Of course, it was the spanish dub then, so its like a new experience to see it in its original language, english.The animation is quite limited, in fact the animators used the original comics to create the animation. Despite its tecnical flaws and poor animation, I still think is very cool.The elemtents of fantasy and action and the narrative is quite epic as only comics can be.Most of the characters are comic versions of mitological norse gods and their manner of speech is fantastic. I like their speech very much but sometimes i just dont get what are they saying like:Odin: "Silence! the thunder god´s word is his bond/bound(¿?)"Thor: "I shall return to Asgard to endure the trial of the gods"Odin: "So be it(¿?)"I find the use of such words and expresions facinating, but, guess I´ll sound dumb if i use them......

She is a model and married with famous actor, Eisaku Yoshida.I like her appearance, sense of fashion, life style, way of thinking.  She always smiles happily and cheers me up.  She is late 30's, but looks very young, cute and sweet.  Recently she published a photo book and held a event to meet her fans at a book store.  When my turn came, I saw her in close and shook hands with her and talked a few words.  She was more beautiful than I expected and I was very excited to speak with her.  I felt like in a dream...  The photo book was very beautiful.  It was took in Paris and her nude is perfect!  She gave me happiness.  Thank you Risa!

Good time of a day! Need your help, English-speakers :)I have a grammar exercise and i see it's too difficult for me at the moment.

In my opinion, diploma is more important for new graduates who are busy looking for jobs. Cause employers know those students  almost have nothing to do with work experience except diplomas. what the emplyers care about is the youth, energy and potential of them.But for those elder job-hoppers, work experience is more important than diplomas. Employers care more about their work experience instead of their diplomas. Work experience is the most powerful competence for them.please help me correct it, thanks a million in advance.

I have a tennis exercise every Monday morning.there are a coarch and five people.When I woke up this morning and looked through the window, it hadbeen raining since last night. I thought the tennis court was going to close, and I couldn't do a tennise exercise. At the time I remembered she had told us it is a good weather or it stops rain whenever she doessomething outside. I said to myself no way.In fact, it had stopped raining before our lesson. It was still cloudy, butwe could do it. Today she had another plan , so she had to go home inthe middle of  the lesson. She left the tennis court. Few minute later,suddenly it started to rain and we had to stop it.I'm sure her story is real. Actually we have never been cancelled our exercise by a bad weather since she joined out team.

I've been surfing on this site for a week and I really think that it's a great site to improve English, (in my case) or any language. People is very kind and they correct your entries in few min. You can made friends and learn about other cultures too. What's the bad point? You can practise listening or speaking. And sometimes native speakers only correct grammar mistakes so although your text is technically correct it don't seem to be real English.

Hello, I'm from Russia. I learn English, Spanish and French. I'd like to learn Arabian, Chechen language, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Portugal and, may be, some oriental languages, but everything is good in its season.I have learned English 9 years at school, 4 years in the University and now 3 months by myself (or: 1.independantly. 2.on self-instruction). I can read in English, also I can understand speach on TV and in the films (movies), but I still couldn't write correctly and could not speak fluently. So, I suppose, this site will help me to learn the language.I live in the city, and I have 2 pets at home: a cat Faina 7 months old and a dog Gray 11 years old. You can see my kitty on the photo. It is very smart and lively. I named my cat in honour of Faina Ranevskaya, the popular actress both in the Soviet Union and Russia. And I named dog in honour of the hero of the story "Scarlet sail" or "Scarlet canvas" by Alexander Grin.Two times a week I go to the open swimming-pool. It is very fun to sweam when it snows. Now it is about -28 degrees C outdoors, but temperature of water in the sweaming-pool is +31. In summer I like to travel, mostly at the sea and towards steppes. I like warm and hot weather, but in my city there are not so many days like this. That is why in winter I go to sweam.

Well, this is my first time here and I'm not used to talk about me on the web. Anyway, I'm a French student and I'm studying English, though my English remains akward and I wish to improve it. Especially because I plan to go in England next year as a French teacher.You know a few about me and why I think this site will be very useful for me, now let me tell you how I found this site.... By chance...Thus, I will try to imply myself by writting here and also correcting others in French language. Both ways will be useful for me.To finish, I should thank and wish good luck for those who will correct me :DSee you soon !

I have one dream, maybe it is not the only one but it is the main one anyway. Do an around the world without time limit, by foot or by bicycle. I will not be totally satisfied until I realize this dream. I just want to meet other people, to discover other cultures, other lifestyles, other landscapes. Not to be stressed by work, by family, by society. Sort of freedom actually. I know that a lot of people do not share my view because they are either too lazy, or not too courageous, or because they simply have not the same dreams.Generally, people are afraid of what they do not know. I do not. I am afraid of the routine, the "métro-boulot-dodo" like we say in french ("subway-work-sleep"). I cannot imagine me spending my entire life in only one place, here in my little village, southern France.I want to travel. That is the only reason why I have started engineering studies, because we can spend one year abroad during the fourth year, and we can do training session abroad too.I wait...

This summer vacation I have spent in Italy! It was one of the best summer vacations for me!I was here when I was 4 years old with my parents. Of course I was too young and I remember very little about our trip! My parents and I visited different cities: Rome, Venice, Vatican, but this year I've seen more.It was my first independent trip, a present from my parents! I had a week of excursions and a week on the sea.I'll try do describe the most important in my trip.First of all the flight was carried over for the reason of air weather. So I had do wait for 10 hours more! It was a little discomfort for me because I was alone in the airport.After 10 hours I was in the sky and my trip had started!I arrived to the Rimini airport in the evening of the local time and the bus carried me to the hotel in San Marino.Next day I saw the group of people with whom I would spend a week in the excursions around Italy. They were nice and sometimes strange. but I find some interesting persons among them! For example, a teacher of French. She is 70 years old, but she likes to travel, she visited different countries and places. It was very interesting to talk with her!This day we got into Venice. Today everybody can read about every place in the internet, so I would tell you only emotions, but not describe the places that I have seen.it should be noted that I am an architect student and this trip was important for me from the viewpoint of architecture.Venice was great! I thought that nothing could be better. But It' was not right! Next day we visited Florence. It was a place where I wanted to go again. I felt a sense of greatness of spirit of the Italian culture walking around the observation point. There are 2 interesting towns: Siena and Pisa near with Florence. I saw them. I liked Siena for it's cathedral and Pisa for Pisa tower. I walked up the stairs to the up of the tower. It was exciting feeling and I saw a wonderful panorama of Pisa.Besides I was in Rome. One day I had excursion with the guide and next day I walked around Rome with one member from our group! It was one of the best moment of my trip! I was here from 8 a.m. till 11 p.m. In the end of the day I was very tired but I felt my self happy!We visited Vatican in the last day of the week and after we had a week on the Adriatic sea! I lived in Rimini and I want only to have sun bath and to swim in the sea after so informative and eventful week. The sea in Rimini is good. Somebody says that It's dirty, but I think that he doesn't sea black sea)) In the morning the sea is calm, but in the evening It's cool to swim in waves! I didn't want to come back to Russia, because It was really good, but I'm sure that I'll go to Italy again!

Hi!  My name is Alex (Sasha in Russian) and I'm from Belarus.I emigrated to the United states almost five years ago and I live in Brooklyn, NY.Unfortunately I have no one to speak with and have no abilities to practice my English. This is very sad - to live in English speaking country and have no way to speak and learn language that is all around you. :(When I first came to the United States I didn't know a single word in English.  I remember standing in the McDonalds the first day I came trying to order a French-fries and diet coke - I opened the mouth and... nothing came from it. I was standing and mumbling something. that was horrible.So, I watched TV and read books - this is the way I learned English.From now on I will write here some thoughts about everything what bothers me. About emigration and cultural differences, about feelings, about America and my view on it.Can you please help me to correct my mistakes? Not only grammatical flaws but also the way I speak. Cause the language is not only the words and grammar rules, it is also THE WAY you speak, the way you express your thoughts.  Many people speaking foreign language often speak it in a very strange way - the way that natives never speak. Because different languages have different structures and different 'language tools' to express same things.  I hope you understand what I'm talking about.Thank you.

Not really, no. But I did get really sick last night, so I had to call in sick this morning. It was a pretty bizzare expreince ; not going to work furious and coming home furious. This is my first real job(I've only been working for like 8 months now.) and I've always thought if I didn't sit in front of my work computer in the morning and slave myself the whole world would just crash and burn. GUESS WHAT. That never happened. I think people didn't even notice that I wasn't even there. Okay, at least some people must have complained about it since they were the ones who had to cover for me, but that's it. Not the end of the world. I think I should do this more often; calling in sick. I feel quite better now and am fully charged with the kind of energy that only someone who watched 20 Grey's Anatomy episodes in a row can have. Great day to feel useless and unwanted. Yoo-hoo!

I cannot agree with the statement. In my opinion, the integration of the modern IT into the educational sphere have not revolutionised the initial principles of education.Certainly, the higher efficiency was reached with the help of the things discussed. It is thanks to computers and the Internet that the speed of gaining knowledge is accelerating now and more people have access to the widest ever range of educational resources.Yet, let us remember that introducing printed books to the public in the Middle Ages did quite the same job: education stopped being so exclusive, the teacher's task became simplified.To sum up, the very idea of interaction between teachers and students, to my mind, is still the same: teachers give knowledge, students collect it. However great help computers and the Internet provide, they only represent the latest aids to learning.

Such a sad story... But I really liked it. It's a love story with a girl who has leukemia.Actors are the same than in "Byakuyakou", that I also liked very much. Ayase Haruka is especially pretty, even if she cuts her hair at the end.I'm a guy, not so young, but I always like stories with romance.

Nice to meet you!I love cello, fursal and engineering. I am a student of University in Fukuoka. Please not be afraid of contact me.In todays diary, I will write about my getting a new favorite song.I got the song in Nagoya at 2 :00 p.m. on last Tuesday. In Japan, last two weeks in the year are called "Golden weeks." Japanese people can have a short vacation in these weeks and tmany of hem enjoy their refreshment. Then I also took refreshment in last Tuesday. I went to Nagoya to listen to classical concert by a lot of cello players. One of　them is my previous teacher of cello and there are professional cello player and students from kinds of schools. The youngest player is 13 years old. They all have great techniques for playing cello.   I found that a lot of songs are very beautiful and they can move very big in the concert. One of them is very impressive for me. The song is composed by David Popper "Polonaise de concerto op.14 arranged by S. Van Eck." The song was arranged for four cello players. The player in the concert are all professional cellists or a graduate school student majoring cello (she is very charmy girl and I was attracted during all of the concert). They are crazy for making music. I was very attracted by the gir...sorry, by the song played by them. They made very good ensemble and their atmosphere very excite me and made my face veery happy and smile during the whole of the song.  The song is very exciting, so please listen to at once(^^). Youtube has a video of that song(for only one cello and a piano.)  It becomes one of my favorite songs list.yeah!!

Poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (PDMDAAC) is a high positive charge of cationic organic polymer flocculant for water and wastewater treatment can also play a bridging role and power in and with less high efficiency, and toxic side effects, taking into account its higher cost, the two mixtures used, give full play to inorganic, organic flocculants advantages to coordination flocculation effect, which in high gem, Xu Chunhua ,etc. In dealing with Jinan, Zibo, etc. found in surface water of the experiment, using the superior composite inorganic coagulant alone (PFS or PAC) and PDMDAAC, the formation of coarse alum, settlement rate, on the pH and surface loading rate of adaptability, but also literature of poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride dissolved in PFS, the stability of the homogeneous complex solution made to examine the flocculation performance. But before and after coagulation aid floc morphology, coagulant dosage and settled water turbidity, CODMn, floc fractal dimension of the relationship between the still to be studied. In general, the structure of flocs with fractal structure characteristics ,fractal dimension and floc size, density, strength And sedimentation rate are closely related, if the floc is more dense and compact form, is easy to settlement.

                 Should Free Music Downloads be Banned?    Some people are in favor of idea of downloading free music. They point out the fact that it can enrich our life, They also argue that free music are good for the music industry because they help increase the popularity of music.    However, other people stand on a different ground, They consider it harmful to download free music. They firmly point out that free music violate the intellectual property rights of musicians. An example can give the details of musical products such as CDs, which may do harm to the whole music industry.    There is some truth in both arguments. But I think the disadvantages of free music downloads overweigh the advantages. In addition to the above-mentioned positive effects it might bring about, Free music also may make people negative in writing music.    (There is an exam next month. This is an practice composition for it.)     请大家帮忙修改下。Thanks.

I know it is a very difficult task for me to write a diary in English, but I felt a terrible impulse to finish it. I went to EF to get an English test yesterday. I had already realized I need to improve my English before the test. I can only speak a few short sentences even just words during the speaking test with the foreigner. Then the consult advised me some suitable courses, but the price is so high that I can not afford it by myself. The fact is that if I want to raise my English level I must pay a mount of time on exercises, or I might not get any increase.It is always said practice makes perfect. Whatever I do I must pay energy and time to do with patient. Although I have the freedom of time I never use it effectively and nearly waste it at will.  I will leave Zhejiang University in a year and half when I get my master degree. I don’t hope I get nothing form ZJU during the two and a half year’s study. I hope I can receive an increase not only in knowledge but also in capability such as practice and language. Anyway , there is a long way for me to work steadily. Well, fighting~

Some people, at my univ. looks like angry guys - one girl saw to me: "You need to be quiet", doeesn't matter :D She is nice in real, i think.After university, i go to the shop, where i bought headphones - Senheizer for about 50 $. Sound is great now!) This is not advertising, or something like that. In the shope, the seller said me: "This is the great thing for your mp3" (i have an ipod) - and it's true.So... After shot i met with my friend in cafe. We told about girls and just drunk our Coca-Cola, from plastic cups.So, thanks for your attention! In the attachment - my photo.)

Children don't go to school on wednesday in France, but this wednesday morning we had a teachers meeting to write that stupid thing called : School's project. This year we will work for a better using of the french language in writtings and we will try to discover other cultures by written correspondence with some class around the world. I think it would be a great experiment. Why not exchanging mails and stuffs with a Japanese school? What do you think Kokki ? ;)This is the end of my first text.

	Love is a long journey that filled with lessons, hardships, heartaches, joys, celebrations and special moments ,that will lead us to our destinations in life.The road will not always be smooth, In fact, throughout  our travels, we will encounter many challenges.	I wanna show you my own opinion about the love between man and woman. It’s must be the most wonderful thing that you share your shoulders with your loved ones when she or he is in troubles, isn’t it?  I think the true love can over come everything. So once you have, please show your love in evey moment and in all kinds of weather.It's not true that if you are sweet to that person then she will love you more. Maybe she will, maybe she won't. But that is not the point to be good and to be noble. To be good, to be noble is for ourselves because we choose to be that way, we want to keep being that way, and we feel good about it. It's not because, "Okay, now she needs me more. If I show more cares, then our love will be stronger"; So love is to give, It’s not the matter of the aim but the act.

As It was so painful I couldnt dare to go home alone by walk but my character is a little ______(not outgoing) so I couldnt ask to help me.One friend said me "shall I take you home?"I said by courtesy "no, I can go home alone" (OK!! please..T_T!!)at that time the other friend said to one friend "dont care, she said she can go home alone"Though I was really really painful so I couldnt think anything but then I could think this..

I could not imagine this situation before I started sitting here and wondering what I can actually accomplish . To me it is awful that my new workmates are ladies over 30, and that during this whole day they just kept on talking about their babies which is a topic I have nothing to express, so I feel a little bit estranged(Is this word correctly spelt?). The worst part is they asked me to do basic work like filling in forms which definitely could not be more boring and time-wasting. I just began to question myself why I am here.Hope things would be better the day after tommorrow, as I will take a rest on Thursday!

Last night, some of my American and Japanese friends and I went to a Japanese restaurant called Mt.Fuji which is said to be the best Japanese restaurant in this state. Some Americans really like Japan. One of the girl was wearing a t-shirts with "I want Japanese boy-friend!" written on it in Japanese. I never thought American girls like Japanese guys. I asked her "You don't think they're wimpy or short? I was thinking most of American girls like macho guys." and she was like, "Some Japanese are not wimpy. I like Sho Sakurai. He is not wimpy at all and he is really funny." She told me that she really likes Arashi which is one of the most popular idol groups in Japan, and I've really liked that group since I was in high school. We couldn't stop talking about Arashi.

Yesterday I was driving on the center-divided road. The road was slightly curved. I couldn't see well a car coming toward me. I sensed the car seem a little closer as an oncoming car. Then I noticed the car running on the exact same lane as mine. I stepped on a blake and stopped. The other car was in front of me. The driver, an Asian male, was smiling apologetically, still driving to the opposite direction. All the cars on the same side of mine stopped, appalled. I avoided the car leaving the mess behind me.  I have no idea why it happened. But as you know, in Japan, cars run on the left side. Maybe he is a Japanese newly here, and entered the wrong lane when he turned at the intersection. Anyway that was a scary moment. I reminded myself that I should be alerted all the time when I'm driving.

    What is hot in China? You will never ever have thought it will be this woman: Luo Yufeng. On internet we call her Sister Feng.     Sister Feng (凤姐), 1.46 meters high, graduated from a junior college, now works in a supermarket as a cashier in Shanghai. She professes that she read much since 9 years old and have reached the peak when 20. "From 300 years ago to 300 years after no one can surpass me." said Sister Feng. She distributed hundreds of thousands marriage-seeking leaflets in Shanghai subway station.     The extremely harsh requirements on the leaflet made her hot overnight. Her requirements, for example, the person must be a master of economics from Tsinghua or Peking University (the most famous in China) and as handsome as possible. He must be 25-28 years old, 176-183mm high and with no experience of making a woman pregnant. He must live in the costal city and have a good job and so on so forth.    Not only the netizens but all the normal people were extremely shocked by her. They think she is too funny and is just sarcasm. However, Sister Feng doesn't think so.     What does she think? Will she continue hot? Next time I'll continue. You can also search "www.baidu.com" and put 凤姐 in the blank for more information.

I just have finished my bussiness trip to Shanxi and Henan,and I was back home this morrning. During this trip, I have been to Taiyuan, Jincheng, Luoyang, and Zhengzhou. In fact, this was my first bussiness trip since I have worked in my company.My leader thinks that it is very  dangerous to be on a bussiness trip alone for a girl, so he nearly arranges a girl to go on a bussiness trip, this time  it's because my Shifu's daughter  would have the college entrance examination, she must stay  to look  after her daughter.But it's ok, i always like to go here and there, and it is easy for me to  have a trip. I was so glad that everything was under my control, firstly I was really worried about the technical problems,there are some alarms with the NC machine when it ran programs,it's really troblesome but finally i fixed it, I modified the control programs in its PLC. Finished my work, I  visited Luoyang, it is also an ancient city.At last I took a train from Zhengzhou to Kunming, campared to taking a plane, I like taking a train to travel better, that's because along the way I also can see lots of beautiful views, and this train trip cost me 37 hours. Looking forward to the next train trip,haha.

I work at the company which is located in the Qibao District. My home is also in the Qibao District and close to Qibao Old Street. There is only one regular bus service that goes to work. It's just two stops way but it take me about half an hour. Because of it's ten minutes' walk from home to bus station and the bus is terribly crowded and uncomfortable. Nevertheless, the company is still a ten minute walk from the bus stop. So I want to buy a bicycle. I think cycling make me independent and keep me fit. I am proud of myself that helping the environment and saving my pocket money. I prefer to walk when the weather's rainning. It's a pleasant walk, trees and flowers all the way. It take me about twenty minutes and I spend the time enjoying the peace and quiet of morning. The bus journey itself is quick, but it's a long wait for a bus. So it's actually quicker to take the whole trip on feet.

Some people think that more severe gun laws are the solution to the problem of gun violence. In the USA, the population can have guns.According to me, severe gun laws are not the solution to the problem of gun violence in the USA, because an association that wants people to have guns, for exemple the NRA.Futhermore, the problem in the USA is that the children take guns tto their parents or it's their parents give it to their children. Consequently if the children has a psychological problem the fact that he carries a gun is dangerous for exemple a boy that shoot his parents ans his sister.In addition, the secont amendement in the USA is that the population can have guns, people can buy a firearm all the months. The consequence is that more and more people kill it's the statistics that say it.To conclude, severe gun laws are not the solution to the problem of gun violence in the USA because the second amendement is that people can have guns. Consequently they are more and more problems of violence and the children make this violence.In my opinion, the people of America must stop to buy firearms.

I have just found this web today, and I think it's really helpful. I hope it helps me to improve my English, and, of course, I hope I can help other people to improve their Spanish as well by correcting them.This is my first message, and, as I have no idea what I could talk about, I'm just going to talk about cats, since I just corrected a Spanish entry whose topic was cats.I have had 5 cats up until now, but sadly, all of them already passed away. However, I will always remember them no matter what. All of them were very cute and playful, and at the same time, each of them was unique on his own way. I couldn't choose (pick?) one over the others, but there's one who was with me during my whole life until he died several months ago. He was a black, big, chubby cat. My parents took him with us when I was a baby and he had quite a large life - he lived for almost 18 years.I hope all of them are happy in the cats' heaven!

Language is a tool for communication and mother tongue is anchor of our life and spirit. Ones should really master their own mother tongue firstly if you want to learn a foreign language very well. Chinese is our mother tongue. She sounds beautifully and is full of wisdom. I believe that the Chinese is a sagacious old man all the time. I enjoy writing down all of my feeling of life in Chinese and appreciate the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature.Now I am going to study some foreign languages such as English, Japanese and Italian because they are beautiful as same as Chinese. I am sure that learning foreign languages has a positive effect on the development and use of mother tongue skills.

Dear friends, how many kinds of Chinese food do you know? I would like to introduce several homestyle Chinese foods. The first one is noodles. There are many kinds of noodles in China. Such as: roolled surface noodles, pulled noodles, knife-cut noodles, and fried noodles. Rolled surface noodles are cutted, shaped, or finished by machine. But pulled noodles are made by hand instead of with a machine. If you go to China, there is a hot pot restanrant named Haidilao. It has a special hand thrown noodle presentation for the hot pot. A noodle specialist will come out and literally throw, pull, and drop the noodles infront of you in a mesmerizing dance. The noodles need to be pulled, and the dance just pulls them in a added value style.Knife-cut noodles are made by shaving fresh off a ball of dough with a sharp knife. And fried noodles are just like stir-fried dishes,especially, the main material of this dish are noodles. All of them are delicious. The second one is Dumplings. I bet you must know of them. You must have watched the famous Kung Fu Panda cartoon movie. Those are two typical kinds of chinese food that are shown in this movie: noodles and dumplings. But we also have another dumpling -  boiled dumplings.  We we often eat these during our spring festival.  The third must be chinese stir-fried dishes.Chinese cuisine has a number of different genres, but the most influential and typical known by the public are the 'Eight Cuisines'.The essential factors that establish the form of a genre are complex and include history, cooking features, geography, climate, resources and life styles.Each cuisine has its own features.      I like chinese food very much. Hope you like it too.

Insanity is everywhere!My junkie junky neighbour has taken to urinating outside my door. It seems that giving beatings to his wife does not suffice anymore.I wonder What his snobby mother thinks of such behaviour. Do you think she would say 'hey! How tender! Look at my crack addicted, coward, women beating son! He has found another way to show how disturbed he has become because of his father´s cheating on me with his secretary, and our failing to show him any affection'?Well I guess that's what daily life is supposed to be on the skidrow, or, better yet, that's what 'royal' eccentricity is like. I guess my nextdoor neighbour is just peculiar. Or maybe crack has just already distroyed his brain. No way of figuring it out.How harsh it is a midleclass mummy's child's daily drama of life! How much life owes you! But life will make up for such injustice by letting you have as much crack as your parents' money can afford, regardless whether they, at last, have to sell their last and most precious possession.Who would have ever thought that pampering might turn an innocent child into such an addicted violent 37 year-old baby. But there is nothing to worry about as long as you walk among people priding yourself on having done such a good work bringing up such a gracious child. Whatever the case is it, the wierdo mind is a puzzle which not even his mother is willing to solve. Anyway, no matter how wicked you are, sun rises again every day.I would even dare to say that women might find this behavior appealing since he managed to get himself a wife. She also doesn't seem to mind his beating her. Not to mention that she gave birth to a child of him. I know! if you put it into perspective, it sounds like a recipe for love. Nothing like sheer violence and nonsense to turn somebody on.Well see you around with more stories from the ghetto. Reality is always much more shocking than fiction! You see? Hey! wait a second! I guess I'm being unjust. I must grant him that he has the courage to get up every single day. How strong is the call of life in this God's creature.

This week's General Linguistics and Grammar tests have both been cancelled "for security reasons". Our teachers decided to postpone them because of the chaos created by the strikes; but they don't know the new dates themselves. Same thing for Detective Fiction.Speaking of which, Mme B gave us our Sherlock Holmes paper back yesterday. She suggested that I rewrote mine because it lacked the structure that the French love so much and even if I had a decent grade (12/20), the ideas I mentionned in it were "easely worth a 16". The thing is we don't learn to write papers like that in Belgium. Here, it's all about writing a plan and sticking to it. I don't mind, though. It's awesome that she gives her students a second shot, and it gives me the opportunity to write more effective essays.There's another vote scheduled for Monday. I suspect that they'll decide to continue the 'blocage' for another week (in spite of the finals), and no one knows what will happen then; we're all a bit paranoid at the moment. It turns out that we'll start with Literature or Civilization on the 15th. We never know which one we'll get because they do a random draw, so we have to study for both. So you spend hours on your desk wondering why you bother trying to remember all of those dates because you have a 50% chance NOT to be interrogated on it anyway (that's completely stupid and so evil in my opinion). Thème and Version (French to English and English to French translation) will be on the same day as Phonetics. That's three total. It's alright, because those are classes where you either know the vocabulary or you don't. I'm a bit worried about Phonetics, though... I instinctively know how to do transcriptions, but I have troubles with the secondary stresses and justifying my answers with the rules or the unbelievable number of exceptions. There are just too many of them. D:

That's the history of my English name, a history of only two years.Of course, I'm a Chinese girl, and major in English. That's another accident in my life, which is filled with coincidences and big surprise.I have no idea why I write this article. I just do it. And I just write down what I have thought of.

Hello,it's the first time I use lang-8.I' m a senior 3 student,and one year later I'll face the College Entrance Examination.It's cruel for us to have this test.I want to receive further education,I'm good at science and mathmatics.But my English is not well.Sometimes I can get high scores but I know that I just know how to get high scores and I can't use English in communication.Every sentence I speak must be considered to be exactly right,I will pay attention to its tense and form.It is a waste of time and my spoken English is extremly terrible.I don't like it, I want to study applied English,not examinatorial English.If you want to know more about Chinese people and you want to help me,please add me to your friends list.

I had so many things to do that I had no time to keed a diary, but I wanna write as frequent as I can from now on:-PI often visit Kagawa known for  Udon for my part- time job.  My friend who lived in there for 8 years took me to a noodle shop.  Although it was a very old and small shop, there were many people.  I ate Udon and tempra.  There were noodle, a raw egg and green onions in the bowl and I added soy sause in it.  It looked simple, but it was delicious!  I wanna eat it again:-) On another note, we held a birthday party for my friends.  It was a surprise party!  We bought two birthday cakes and put them in a bar, we're going to hold a party before we went to there.  We could drink all we want for 3000 yen there, so we ate and drunk too much!  Maybe...we gained at least 1 kilograms.  OMG!!  We have to exercise!  A few hours later, we took cakes out.  They're so impressed.  It made me happy＼(^o^)／  We enjoyed the party.  After that, we went to karaoke.  We sung and laughed!  We sung English songs too.  It was difficult, but it was interesting(^^♪  I wanna be able to sing them better★!  Anyway, it was a amazing day!

I don't really know how to start it... Anyway, I'm Russian, I'm a total nerd and I'm not used to meeting new people, online or in 'real' life. I'm interested in learning foreign languages - only my German still sucks. Also I've just started learning Hebrew and Latvian.A few of the (random) things I'm interested in: Soviet cinematography, post-punk music, Superhero movies, Malcolm McDowell, Stanley Kubrick, Luchino Visconti, Fritz Lang, silent movies, zombies, Gothic Lolita fashion, Jane Austen, Choderlos De Laclos, Akutagawa Ryunosuke, Anton Chekhov, Joseph Brodsky (I actually read to much, as I'm a literature major. There are way too many authors that I like).Oh, I also have to admit that I watch The X-Files every day.

    I'm a Chinese, but it doesn't mean I was born in Beijing. Beijing is the capital of China with long history, and it's in the northeast of China. I came from Guangxi Province in the south part of China. The climate between Beijing and Guangxi is really different. Guangxi is hot in summer and warm in winter. Beijing is also hot in summer but really cold in winter, especially for me, I' m afraid of coldness very much.    I came to Beijing when I was 8, because my mom and dad decided to come to the modern city to find their fortune. Because the winter in Guangxi is warm, so I haven't seen snow before I came to Beijing. I still remember how I feel when I saw the pure snow the first time, so exciting and curous, I touch the cold snow and yelled to my mom surprising. And the next I went to school, my friends threw the snow to me and I threw it back to them happily. How unforgottable the memory was!    I also love the buildings in Beijing. The ancient buildings are classical, the new buildings are modern. The Summer Palace is my favorite place. It's one of the most famous places of interest in Beijing, even in China. There are lakes, hills, the long corridor, the buildings. They are so fantastic! Thousands of paintings was painted on the roof, the pillar, the bridge raillings and so on. I really feel proud of the wistom of our ancesters.    oh that's really a long story, thank you very much to help me corret it.

When I was still in high school I had English lesson, since in Belgium we talk 3 languages and 2 of them are the main languages (French and Dutch) I had only 2 hours of English and then 2 hours of Dutch,...Although I followed at school the Dutch lessons, I couldn't talk Dutch, why? because Dutch it's hard language and if you don't practice what your learn, you'll very fast forget it. French is my native language but I live now in the Dutch area so here I am learning Dutch again, but this time I won't forget my Dutch :pI think that the learning language system is not that good in Belgium, but it's get better since you can study in complet from middle school in English or Dutch.

          This is  an aged  saying ,but the truth in it is universal;we can do everything no matter how complex it is as long as we spare no efforts to do it.No one can deny it,for it is self-evident.          The ancients realized this in the early time and the saying has passed on with time going by,while in this present-day society ,numerous people still turn a dear ear to it.On the  one hand,they are keen on  being surrounded with successful glory;on the other hand,they are reluctant to take practical action.Worse still,they are always complaining about the bad fortune or the difficulty  of the task instead of their insufficient work when they fail to make it .They owe other's success to good fortune ,which is rather rediculous.They do neglect the fact that diligence is the mother of good fortune and success is no accident.         No man is born wise or learned ,it is the hard work that makes it possible for man to be what he wants to be .And nothing in the world is difficult for one who sets his mind to it.Let's take Stephen Hawking for example.Be diagnosed with an incurable disease and may not have more than twelve months to live,Hawking went on with his research and continued pursuing his dream through thick and thin instead of   giving up .Disease though has disabled him ,his efforts kept him moving .Seated in  a wheelchair and speaking  through a computer can not discourage Hawking ,for no way is impossible to courage.As expected,pleasure comes through toil,Hawking naturally reached his goal at last. His discoveries about the Big Bang and black holes contributed greatly to the scientific research,and his work A Brief History Of Time proved  to be a best-seller.Globly fameous  as he was,no one knows exactly how much he paid for his success.            Thus,I dare say ,no pains ,no gains.Nothing is difficult  to the man who will try, and Hawking sets a typical example  for us .There is no point in complaing about the fortune or the task itself,it is absolutely only a waste of time .AS the saying goes,better to light one candle than to curse the darkness.So don't hesitate to take effective action and never say die once you make your mind to  do something,just for the fact that nothing in the world is difficult to the man who will try !

He was the first that started to practices Chinese martial arts in Occident.I consider that Bruce lee is a hero because he taught his martial arts and kun fu to everybody and these are at that moment arts that practice around the world. People practice by sport, the health, personal protection and mental discipline.

Shaya, ahoj! Děkuji moc! O Krasnojarsku - ovšem měl jsem na zřeteli "krásná". Ještě divná [tady je "weird" :)] věta "mít na zřeteli", ona je správná? Vzal jsem ji na slovnik.seznam.cz.  Mimochodem, prosím vás, nevíte, existuje li nějaký online slovník, kde bych jsem mohl seznat všechno o nějakém slove: množné číslo, skloňování, rod. Na www.pravidla.cz ně vždy je potřebná informace. Poslouchám ted' různé české pohádky a myslím že jsou moc nemilosrdný :) Ve červené karkulke - karkulka naplnila vlkové břicho velkými kameny a jsi zabil se, ve pohádce o zlatovlásce - Jiřík "skočil s koně a vrazil mu do boku meč, aby krkavčata měly co žrát". Ale Jiřík rozuměl co zvířata mluví, a tedy rozuměl svého koně, který, myslím že neměl radu byt zákuskem pro krkavčat :)) Ooooch, to je těžko psát v češtině :)

Hi, it's the first time I've written here. And firstly I'd like to ask the question (acutally, I don't even know can you reply me or not, since I've not found this function yet).Yesterday I was at my teacher. She prepares me for taking IELTS exams. I'm going to take academic module.I was describing what was the article I am reading about. The speech was about sands and deserts, and I said the following sentence 'Overall, the article is about things of which the deserts consist.' But the teacher corrected me, she interrupted me saying that it's completely wrong and this structure of sentenses is just in 'russian-style'. She said, that most proper way of expressing that mind would be 'The article is about thing the deserts consist of'. But, I still have doubts as I acquainted with that form of sentenses (of which) much time ago, I saw the example of using certain word in lingvo online dictionary and noticed that construction. So, that sounded like 'We need to consider more particularly the facts of which those issues arise', where we can see the same 'of which' construction. In fact, she said it's understandable (I'm about ''The article is about things of which the deserts consist.'', but she added it's not correct sentense anyway, while my mate said it's okay but too formal and there is no mistake in this sentense.Well, I wonder, who's wrong: me, my teacher or lingvo?

Hi there!My name is Esteban and I'm writing here for the very first time... I was dragged here by Tofugu this certain guy who vloggs and gives away resources to those who are self-teaching themselves Japanese online. Textfugu, is his website. Good that I knew him so I can give it a try to this Lang-8 thing. I am also fond of Japan and Korea but at the time I am not studying these languages although I expect to start studying them soon. In the mean time I'll write over here to perfect my English. Actually "perfect" is a word too heavy to carry around. I'll say then that I want to learn more and more! :D It's been aproximately 4 years since I formally started studying English but I almost never have the chance to be corrected when I practice either because my friends are too kind to me or because I don't usually write letters or any document in English or beacause I am not understood. :(I want to write over here every now and then and become more confident in my writing. Also I really enjoy practicing and sharing stuff in this my second language. I look forward to being corrected and to have my most common mistakes pointed out. I think I can take that as long as you don't go too hard on me. I thank you all in advance and I hope to know more about you over here. I am at your disposition if you ever need a native Spanish speaker. I'm from Mexico BTW but since I study literature (esp. playwriting) I think I can be very useful if ever required by you no matter which spanish you are learning.  My spelling is one little problem I have and that is one thing I believe is important for me to be advised in. Since I've been learning from teachers who thaught both American and British English the outcome of my writing might be a strange strange mixture them. I want to be consistent with BrE since the last two years I've been learning under a British-like system, but well, that's too much to say in a firts entry.I know it might be difficult to explain to me every error y might do... so I thank you again if you can comment me.Oh boy am I nervous!!

[This is a letter of self-introduction. plz read it with your patience.]First of all, I am honored to apply for the subsidiary materials team at NOBLAND. I have a high interest in subsidiary materials because completion of the apparel manufacture depends on exact orders, letting-off and management so that it takes important roles to make apparels high qualities. Among the lots of apparel manufacture companies, NOBLAND regularly satisfies buyer’s needs through lively supports of R&D. Moreover NOBLAND shows record breaking growths since they established. That really motivated me to be a staff at NOBLAND and got a willingness of learning motive power that NOBLAND became the present position.  Since I was a sophomore at university, I started to work as an intern at fashion companies that handle from apparel fabric to ordering and production. I had an internship program at E.LAND as a VMD in 2010 and I have monitored work of staffs and then comprehended two things. Firstly, it is thoroughly preparing data. Always note necessary parts and search the book to gratify lack of work in the given time. Secondly, it is quickness. I prioritize work to achieve goals. These two postures help workflow more flexibly.        For my good points, I have an optimistic personality that I always have a positive mind in facing situations with tendency to find joy in my own behavior.  So, I believe I rarely get stress when compare to other people in the same situation. Moreover talking with people alone, I am able to easily forget about bad memories.  I reckon this is my biggest strength.  For example, I have been left alone in the middle of nowhere while I was having an overseas trip due to the lack of communication skills. However, I considered this event as a charm of the overseas trip, and started to study really hard on foreign languages. I strongly believe that these positive aspects will definitely help me through the situations like having an unexpected trouble with colleagues at NOBLAND.  The other strong point is that I am good at listening.  I believe the communicational errors cause the company loss.  Therefore my strong point is necessary for the position of subsidiary materials which communicate sales team and partner firm.  I would like to be a staff that satisfies buyer’s needs. I am ready to enjoy the work and to be a member of your team.  It would be my pleasure if you contact me (Cell: 010-6622-2850) for further discussion at the interview.  Thank you for your time and consideration.

Learning a foreign language is a hard thing for me,especially English. As I seldom watch American TV programs nor listen to English pop music.(I prefer to rock,but usually I can't clearly make out what the word is.) I like Linkin Park, Evanescence, Within Temptation ,L'arc en ciel, and Rammstein.I also like Enya, Sarah Brightman and Kanafina.I love anime and comic.But recently I haven't found anything interesting. I'm feeling like moving on from anime and comics now. It may be a good thing for me now as I need to pay more attention to my study this year, and also the following one.After 2 years living without English, I found I've almost forgotten it . How to spell the word "foreign"? What is the word "graduate "in English ? Questions is arising one after another.  I'm like a junior learner, a student in primary school. Oh, I think I really need lots of time to improve my English now.

This is a very interesting topic to discuss, though it is very difficult to reach a consensus.In my opinion, at first step, we should give an exact and clear definition of the success and the life, for we can’t judge the importance of these two things without a limit. And then the different importance depends on our definitions of success, of life.I would like to divide people in two parts. One is so called “the person of their own”, like the holy man, the monks in India, the Taoists in China. They will only be interested in the self-satisfaction and pursue the inner harmoniousness. What is the good luck or the bad luck? These things mean nothing to them. However they will really pay much attention to the theological ability .The ability is rather more important than the good luck .Not only the monks, there also exist samples like them in the ordinary life, but very few. The other part are the people like most of us, “the social person” .The famous and important people like the political leaders are the best samples. These guys cannot live or achieve their life goals without a social environment. Of course, they also emphasize the importance of ability, but I think their great success are also the results of good luck, at least it is so to some degree. People often say that the good chance is for the ready people, but who gives the chance?  It is the good luck that gives them the chances to show their ability. There are so many smart and good guys like him in his country, why does he become the winner at last? There must be some good luck in the factors to explain his success, but in a key point, the good luck is often the determined one.

 I learned Japanese as my major in the University.Though I passed CET-4 and CET-6,I can't write and speak much in English.Frankly,I regret having not study English hard in the University.I studied English from the middle school,and I was really interested in it.Because I have to prepare the Intenational Japanese test 1st grade,maybe it's not correct.I paid my all attention after I passed the CET-6,and learned nothing about English.After gratuating from the University,I started to work  in this company until now.My work is not busy,so I want to learn something that maybe help me when I want to change my work.Write these things in English is really difficult to me,but I won't give up.I think one of the reasons is that the difference between Japanese and English is too much,sometimes I can't make quick reaction,for example,grammar and so on.Now,after the company,I read something both in English and Japanese,and I hope I can master both of them.Certainly,I have to work hard.

But I want to believe even if there exist no contact between them,but if they　feel they are important to each other, their relationships is able to be called friendships.

Since 10 years ago I have lived in Peñalolén, one of the 32 communes of the Greater Santiago in the Metropolitan Region. Peñalolén (in Mapudungun “fraternal meeting people”) was founded on 15 of November of 1984, and since that year, it has had five mayors; the current one is Claudio Orrego.Specifically, I live in Cousiño Macul Park Condominium, one of many condominiums here are. It is located around a Jumbo supermarket, a school, and many minimarkets, so it is for sure a very convenient place to live.Peñalolén has 4 areas or little neighbourhoods: High Peñalolén, Lo Hermida, La Faena and San Luis of Macul, and it also has a lot of green areas, such as Viña Cousiño Park, Quebrada de Macul and Arrieta Park, among others.I think my neighbourhood is a very convenient one, because it has a great amount of supermarkets (many Jumbo and Lider), schools (such as Pumahue School and Mayor School, where I studied), universities (SEK International University and Adolfo Ibáñez University, one of the most technological and also expensive universities in Santiago), and also a lot of parks and local markets attended by local people where neighbours can buy fruits, vegetables and even clothes and furniture at lower prices.One of the great things I think Peñalolén has to offer to the community, and also to visitants, is its many touristic attractions. Only in this commune, there are 10 different places to visit, enjoy, and learn more about its history and people. For example, you can choose among: Arrieta’s Old Estate House and Park, Mapuche’s Rhuka Kimn, where you can learn about the Mapuche’s culture and even meet some of them, Peace and Commemoration Park Villa Grimaldi, Cantalao Native Forest Centre, Quebrada de Macul Park’s Andean Mountain Gap, Cousiño Macul and Aquitania Vineyards, La Rosa and El Sol Arts and Handicrafts Towns, and the Ecological Community, all with their beautiful sights and special charm.If you have the opportunity to visit Peñalolén, come and enjoy its beauty and what it has to offer to anyone who wants to have an awesome time.

TOPIC: ISSUE221 - "The chief benefit of the study of history is to break down the illusion that people in one period of time are significantly different from people who lived at any other time in history."WORDS: 462          TIME: 00:45:00          DATE: 2008-9-8 15:39:43I concede that the human nature has not changed over the recorded history, and coming to know this fact by studying history, is beneficial to better living in our current society. However, the statement unfairly generalized about the value of history in two respects. First, there still are other markedly different ways in which people in other different periods worked. Second, studying history is not merely beneficial to inform us that the human nature is unchangeable. I agree with the speaker insofar as by study history, we learn that the basic human nature--our desires and motives, as well as our fears and foible-- has never changed over the recorded history. Through study history, we try to summarize a way to prevent the tragedies in our living society, though to no avail. For instance, the history teaches us, the desires and motives of rendering a war have not change from the time of the Crusades to recent Iraq war--to strive for resource from others. Also, the history teaches us, the human mistakes and society illness are here to stay. For instance, the Environment problems would here to stay; the crime and the violence have trouble in every society; all manner to solve or reform are not available even using the most serious punishment, or only with partial success.However beneficial it might be to appreciate the unchanging nature of human being, it is equally important to understand and accept the significant difference between different periods of time, including the insight of culture, customs, social value and ideals. For Instance, the way in which societies treat women have been changing from the elder time to current time. Society's attitudes towards the wars and environment have continuously evolved over the course of human history. Learning the changing and evolution of different societies help us formulate informed, reflective, and enlightened values and ideals for ourselves and the society we are living also benefit as a whole.Another problem of the statement is that it unfairly overlooks other equally important value of the studying history. Through studying the courage and tenacity of great leaders, explores and other great achievers in the history can inspire us to attain the similar achievement in our time, at least it is helpful to reduce the fear when we are facing new troubles in the way of reforming our time. Studying the mistaken of other societies can help us avoid repeating them. For instance, we come to know by studying history that in any democracy a leader who relies on deception and secrecy to preserve that leadership, to advance a private agenda, or to conceal selfish motives, betrays the democracy—and ends up forfeiting the political game. In the other hand, learning about one’s cultural legacy, or roots, fosters a healthy sense of self and cultivates an interest in preserving art, literature, and other cultural artifacts—all of which serve to enrich society.In sum, the history tells us the human nature has not changed over the different recorded history. And the lesson of history can help us improve the connection and tolerance between us and others. However, the history can teach us other things--to help us obtain collect value and ideal when we are eager to change our time.

  I have learned Korean for about two years. Generally speaking, my Korean level can reach to middle. However, cause we only took this course once a week for only 1 hour and also cause i haven't spent a lot of time on it. My Korean just stops at "안 녕 하 세 요; 안녕히 가세요" , such kind of easy greeting sentences.  These days I am staying at home, waiting for job notice. It is non-sense to watching TV or surfing on the Internet. Thus, I decided to learn Korean by myself though it is somewhat difficult. I will try my best to learn it well. U know, I have another important reason to study Korean. Because in the last two months, I fell in love with a Korean boy. It was a nice and perfect memory. In this process, we had a large number of interesting things. Under some circumstances, when we don't want the other to understand , I would use Shanghai dialect while he would use Korean. Though i have learnt Korean before, it was still tough for me. And now this guy has already said byebye to me and went back to Busan. He promised that he would never go to Shanghai except travelling. In order to commemorate my "first love", I'm sure that I will exert all my energies to Korean.  Maybe some day we will come together again, at that time I will make him feel surprise for my Korean.   Last night I successfully typed my first Korean word" 허 일 우"on computer. It was interesting.kkkk...  화이팅!

For me,learning English is a necessity,while learning Japaness is totally out of interest. As it known to almost every Chinese,English plays such an important role in each stage during Chinese people's studenthood as far as the the compulsory education is concerned,the influence of which is too huge to be neglected.English learning is flooded in every corner of Chinese cities,or countryside,.Forgive me if it sounded a lit exaggerating，it's almost true.The English-learning phenomenon is getting too crazy that a team of the vanguard Chinese educators had to stand out calling for law legislators to put more emphasis on the traditinal Chinese learning.However one thing that you should be informed of the Chinese education,the chance of being enrolled in a top university would be slim to none if that person failed in the English test during the Entrance Examination to College.I have seen lots of the aboved-mentioned example around me.The situation is changing slightingly, though I don't see it make any difference.Funnily enough,on one point the so-called influential people holding the progressive banner would call for the stop of the over-expanded craziness on learning English,on the other hand they keep evaluating  students' abilities based on their scores of the English tests.As for Japaness Learning,there is no pressure coming around.Since I have no intention in taking any sort of test,I learn it in my most pleasant way,whether it's a good way or bad one,it's my way.I was nitpicked more than once for my Japaness-writing and pronuciation esp. those on Hitagana which I suck at very much.I guess it has lots of things to do with the fact that a large quantity of Japaness words written in Hitagama are directly changed from English pronuciation.As stubborn as I am, to forsake the original English pronuciation for the sort of strangely unfamiliar one is the last thing I will force myself to do.My point is as long as I can carry on a proper conversation with the those who speak Japaness,the result doesn't seem that important as the process,does it?Surely different people will have a different take.Frankly speaking,I am a lit bit envious of the native English speakers.Instead of having to start out a new session of language learning,you guys were born to embrace the ability of speaking this internationally-acknowledged language.But I guess it's a double-edge sword if we really puts our feet into the situation.The fact is to be able to speak in English may have let you guys lose lots of chances to be getting closer to a differnt fascinating culture now that people coming from various nationalities choose to pick up English as their second language,or I might be in the wrong side.Anyway,my envious part definately takes the upper edge.Will Chinese become the internationally-speaking Language one day?Could be though.The point is regardless how eagerly I wish for it to happen so that it could alleviate some burdens on the Chinese students, at this moment only does it exist in my sweet dreams...

Dear friends, I need your help!I'am preparing the introduction for my term paper at British history. But i am afraid that i have a lot of mistakes.. %))Here it is:The History of England is very profound and many-sided. It totals a huge number of events and the persons, who anyhow influenced it. In each epoch there were key moments and figures about which it is possible to read a lot of the interesting.I consider that one of the most ambiguous figures of English history is the representative of the Tudor dynasty,  daughter of king Henry VII  - Maria the First or as she is also named -  Bloody Mary. This name is still shrouded by set of secrets and legends. There are no monuments put in her homeland, people associate the period of her reign with bloody massacres; day of her death (and simultaneously day of accession to the throne Elizabeth I) was marked in the country as a national holiday. We see the picture gloomy enough, but it has involved me in this historic figure. Having read about the queen at a history lesson, I have started to search for the every possible information about her, to read various books, to see the films connected with her personality. When I have looked an English serial "Tudors", about this great dynasty, I became assured that my term paper will be about Maria. I wanted to learn more about this strange, fanatical queen who has doomed to death a large quantity innocent people.In my work I have tried to track Maria's life from a birth, to the death.I have collected every possible legends connected with her and the facts of her biography which prove that this person was historical and that it is noteworthy.

Hello, world! :)Today I'll try to tell you about russian system of education. This theme is very close to me: i have graduated institute last year and going to enter a post graduate course.Russian system of education is being reformed nowadays: from our own system, we are coming to the Bolognese system. Let's start with russian original system.In Russia (and other in former soviet republics) we divided education into several main stages: elementary school, secondary school, higher school and then science degrees are coming.Elementary school consists of three or four forms (from first to fourth. Fourth one can be omitted ), secondary school consist of five forms (from fifth to ninth). I would say, higher school should be divided into two main part: two highest forms in schools and five or six years of institute (or university).After elementary school pupils are able to read, write, count. After secondary school pupils can do everything mentioned above, their math skills are hardened, they should know basic physics, chemistry, biology, at least one foreign language, geography, history and may be some basic philosophy. At this point pupil get high education.Many people stops at this point: high education is enough for life ;) Almost everyone in Russia graduates from high school.Higher school is much more difficult to enter and to graduate. So it was very prestigious to have higher education. Nowadays bribery prospers everywhere, so higher education lost most of its prestige. Nevertheless, after higher school you receive a title of a specialist. As a specialist you are considered to be able to solve difficult abstract and applied problems, to be skillful at your speciality, to be able to do economic forecast, concerning your projects. But in every institute or university students learn a wide range of sciences. For example, as an engineer (a programmer), I had to learn russian language (a bit), philosophy, an arrangement of semiconductor devices, theory of problems solving and many other thing, I don't really use in everyday work.Last term in higher school is almost totally devoted to a degree work. In this work you should propose some minor improvement of something already invented (can I say "being used"?).After higher school students can go for a higher academic degrees. In russian system these are "candidate of a science" and "doctor of a science". In brief, to become a candidate of a science, you have to compose existing things, ideas to a some new system, to archive a  solution of a fundamental problem. To become a doctor of a science, you have to propose something really new to the science (or convince everyone, that you proposed something new).Next time, I'll try to write something about novelties in russian education.P.S. I didn't expect, I would need a dictionary so many times.

The issue whether people should choose a job with a high salary or more vacation time is a topic that is often discussed and there are differing opinions about this issue. Some prefer to have a high salary, because they could buy some things that they like most, while others would choose a job with more vacation time for enjoying themselves. In my view, I prefer to have a job with more vacation time instead of a high salary for several reasons.Admittedly, earning money is one of the aims of our work. No one could deny the fact that money could not only maintain our daily lives but also could help us to achieve some of our personal goals, such as buying a car, living in a big house or helping those who live in poverty or starvation. Making money will enable us to improve our living environment and quality, and therefore getting a job with a high salary, is significant to us. However, others go into rapture at mere notion of getting money, however having a job with a high salary, is less useful than many people believe. People, who are addicted to a high income, have to spend more time working or staying in the office, and as a result, it is impossible for them to devote enough time and energy in communicating with family members. Moreover, it is difficult to develop and cultivate their children’s character and interpersonal skills and they may become more solitary and even suffer from certain emotional or psychological problems. Therefore, it is undesirable to hanker for a high salary instead of staying with family members. Furthermore, the majority of people believe that having more vacation time will provide them additional opportunities to broaden their horizons, which may put them in a favorable position prove their situation. As we know, traveling can allow us to actually meet different cultures, which we could not get from textbooks or classrooms. As an architect, although he could learn about masterpieces from the internet and magazines, the feeling of touch of the actual buildings, such as the Sydney Opera house, is totally different， We could find abundant information about the plans, sections and elevations, but we could not recognize the size, the space or the material. Having vacation time and traveling could provide us with an opportunity to realize the dream and therefore almost all of us benefit from vacation time.Therefore, I am firmly convinced that having a job with more vacation time, will bring about a profound impact on families, the person himself and even the society as whole.

I find the best way to studying foreign language is reciting classic and exellent text.It is heart-stirring if there are some foreigners who are in the same residential area with you could talk to you everyday, but maybe it is not everyone have the advantages, so, as a language learner, we must find more probable conditions to practise. As time goes by, I think reciting is a good way to elevate language studying to a new level.When I was a university student, I was so boring about reciting new words, It seems that the appearances of new words and expressions always like hurricane or storming everyday. At first time I was scared to face them, then I thought I couldn't just like a rat in a hole and waited to death(of course the final exam...), so I began to recite proses and poems, finally it works.At present, I continue my Japanese studying and I find it is hard to use the same method. The fact is Japanese text always use many characters without kana, at most time I don't know how to pronunce the new words when I face them, so I must check them by dictionary, it is really a big problem! But I am optimistic about the future, I think there must be a hard time, not just to me but also to every language learner, when I pass it, I'll find come through finally.Just do it! ~

A public debate on should government spend more money on improving highways or public transportation has arisen to attention. There are diverse attitudes from people with distinguishing backgrounds. Some people like ones living in villages argue that government should spend more money on improving highway; while, to some extent, some city folks prefer investing in public transportation. Personally speaking, I recommend that government should spend more money on improving highway. There are several conspicuous aspects as follows.The main reason for my propensity is that highway is playing a vital role in the development of the villages, since highway could closely connect rural and urban. Firstly, living in a noisy place for a long time, city people more would like to spend their holidays in villages where is quiet, close to the nature, and with less pressure which is health for them. Thus, it would boost rural travel industry. Moreover, higher and higher house price in cities have forced a lot of people, especially young people, to take a heavy burden. With highways, it is much easier for them to drive between cities and villages daily, so they can choose a relatively cheaper house in villages near the cities. Thus, many companies, such as super markets, will be introduced to villages and prompt the development of the villages.Another reason for my propensity is that highway is an infrastructure which building highways will provide relatively many jobs for some people who are the unemployed. Take building a highway as example, government building a highway, which is a huge project. It needs more many people to work and it is one of solutions to question that help the unemployment. It provides guarantee the unemployed a basic living level, highway is free to people as well. Moreover, an enterprise is not able to building a highway for it has not enough money to support it. Even if it has ability to build it, the aim of the enterprise is attain more many profits from it. Such as: the establishment of toll gate is a common phenomenon. This is a very huge expense that individual driving one’s own car to work will spend around 50 yuan from villages to cities which have 40 kilometer daily. However, government builds highways to serve the people by the people to pay taxes. All in all, some people may still remain unconvinced, the reasons I have analyzed could at least make them more aware of the various dimensions of the issue under discussion. There is little doubt that more and more people will come to realize that government should spend more money on improving highway. Not only provide so many job to people who is the unemployed, but also provides a convenient and fast service to people who are living in the villages and work in the cities.

I've been a Brightkite user thesedays.It's a kind of web service like Twitter, but more interesting because it connects Twitter-like short comments and locations and we can search people who are also using Brightkite around us, though I cannot know who he/she really is, and what type of person he/she is.Though we can use it from PCs, we should use it from mobile devices like iPhone, iPod touch, or android.Comparing my iPod touch and android, I realized the importance of multi-task.When I want to know the location of someone, I can touch the map window inside the Brightkite-appli, then a bigger size google map opens.But at this time, iPhone/iPod touch closes the original appli (Brightkite) and opens the Google Map appli, because they are made as single-task.Therefore, when I finish viewing map and want to return to Brightkite, I have to close the Google Map appli pushing the button below and have to restart the Brightkite appli again.On the other hand, android is a multi-task device, so I can open Google Map appli and Brightkite appli at the same time. I don't have to close one appli when I use the other. I can see Maps inside the Brightkite appli.At this point, I think android is better than iPhone, though I know this has both advantage and disadvantage at the same time.Anyway, thanks to the large number of Brightkite users who are checking in from "iPhone", I and many other users can enjoy the great system.

In this figure we can see the proportions of employed students four month after they left their universities from 1995 to 2001. As can it be seen the number of men and women that found full time job rose gradually. Over the period more men employed than women.From year to year number of employed men stays more than women? especially in 200 year, when percentage of employed men reached just over 84%. However, the number of men and women is equal in 2001 year.From the chart it can be concluded steady grows of similar rate of male and female ex-students that got a job in four month time, but we can notice there is slight fall in 2001 year.

Finally I had reached the safe house.Twenty more steps, the groaning echoes of the undead still ringing in my ears as I remembered everything that had happened in the last 24 hours. Ten more steps, the undead were closing in but I just clenched on to the only thing giving me the strength to continue.My feet felt weak, five more steps, every breath came in shallow and painful, my body groaned in protest, exhaustion was making my vision blurry but I just had to reach that door, that one door that lead to safety and back to my team.I heard glass breaking as windows were shattered. I looked up just in time to see my friends taking positions on the windows of the fourth story house we were using as shelter for the time being. The first volley was shot and took the first row of zombies with them but there were still too many of them. Finally, I reached the door, just as I was about to twist the door knob I felt someone tug at the collar of my shirt, the rooting smell of the undead filled my nostrils as the zombie’s head aligned to my neck and prepared to sink it’s mouth into my flesh, I was too tired to move, too weak to protest I closed my eyes and waited, welcoming death like a long lost friend.The seconds ticked by, and I didn’t feel anything. Am I dead? I found myself asking, just as a warm hand grabbed my hand and helped me stand up. “Get up, dummy!” that voice woke me up from my trance and I opened my eyes.

Recently, there have been lots of newspaper and public figures criticizing the policies implemented by the Mexican government in order to lessen the impact of the global crisis in Mexico. The comparisons between Brazil and Mexico are inevitable: how is it possible that the Mexican economy had contracted 7% and the Brazilian only 0%? Moreover, why Mexico was the worst Latin American country dealing with the global financial crisis?First of all, let's say some facts. According to the National Institute of Statistic and Geography (INEGI), Mexican exports are heavily dependent on the USA market (75% of its exports are to the States). In Mexico, the states with the highest rates of economic growth (above 4%) are the northern ones: Baja California, South Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, Sonora, Tamaulipas and also Aguascalientes and Quintana Roo (this one in the south). The northern states, which are the ones more integrated with the USA economy, are export led economies, such as Aguascalientes and Quintana Roo, which is famous resort dependent on the US tourists.Now, taking into account that fact (that the Mexican states which are leading the economic growth in Mexico are export oriented economies with the US as the main destiny of its exports). It is not surprising that the Mexican economy had experimented that kind of economic contraction.In South America, there is no state so dependent on the US market like Mexico. The solution would be to diversify the trade, but you know that since the end of the XIX century, Porfirio Díaz, a Mexican "dictator", stated that diversifying the trade was a necessary condition in order to reduce the dependency of the Mexican economy in relation to the United States economy.If it happened that the Mexican economy would increase it's net output following an export oriented solution, it would be through an increase in exports to the USA. There are trade models based in the fact that bigger economies tend to "attract" the exports from the nearer countries. Unless Mexico managed to create goods which are not demanded from citizens in the United States -or strengthen its internal market-, Mexico won't be able to avoid the effects of the US crises.

At the beginning of the short humorous story “News for a peeper”, written by Peter Langdale,  we meet the main character, a curious newly married woman Stella. Bill and Emily are married for only three months, but they already have to face with usual problems of incompatibility and bad temper of each other. Emily, having no experience in relationship, sees that her husband pays less and less attention to her. She is already fed up with his temperament and lack of sense of gratitude. Being curious what Bill is going to do if she deserts him, one day Emily lets her imagination and impulses control her and leaves. She writes a farewell note and puts it on the dressing table. Just for appearance she packs few suitcases with clothes and goes out with a strong intention to never come back untill her husband Bill feels guilty and begs her back. But the lure of missing his reaction eats her up. And then another, more terrible thought comes into her mind: after reading the note her husband may take to drinking or even kill himself! On reflection of preventing the disaster she comes back. Her curiosity triumphs over her sanity and she lurks under the bed, the most appropriate place for peeping without being noticed. Of course, she is certain that her husband barely can discover her naïve plan.  Bill comes home. After reading the note he puts it away into his pocket, and the things unexpectedly goes in a completely different way: instead of loosing his head, he takes out his best suit and puts it on. Displaying his great mood, he begins to hum a joyful melody. Such behaviour throws Emily for a loop – he scarcely seems repentant. He writes something on the note, puts it back to the dressing table and leaves. This note must illuminate Bill’s unforeseen actions. Puzzled, Stella crawls out and reads: “It’s much softer ON the bed”. It is apparent that Bill has disclosed the entire plan after reading the note. Certainly she, hiding under the bed, anticipates quite different reaction. He is a judicious man with a big deal of sense of humour, and that’s why he, propeled by desire to mock at her, seats hevily on the bed in order to hold Emily up to ridicule, clearly demonstrates his changing mood. On the other hand, his respond may let us guess that he loves her much, but doesn’t want to be controlled and gives her a lesson.Summing up, I find this short story interesting, indeed humorous. Its plot changes unexpectedly and it was really amusing to read it. The author gives us a good, vivid example of life of newly married coples and their problems, accentuates on one of the most widespread mistakes of young women – desire to control each action of their husbands.

This film is a definite must watch. How good is it? I watched it over 80 times!!! That's how good it is. I should have shared it with you guys long time ago. If you want to go to Japan or are going to Japan, I strongly recommend you watch it before you go to Japan. You won't regret it.  This guy, Tyler MacNiven, walked the entire length of Japan back in 2004. It's no mistake. He walked from the southernmost tip of Japan all the way up to the northernmost tip of Japan. That's 2000 miles!! It took him 5 months to complete his, I would say, "odyssey." To him, it was an odyssey of discovering various lifestyles and traditions in Japan and walking into the hearts of the Japanese people, and I'm sure it will be for you, too, when you watch the film as it was for me. This is possibly the best documentary video about Japan ever produced. Maybe, I'm exaggerating a little, but in my mind it's the best.  I laughed, cried, and felt lifted to a better place whenever I watched it. After watching the video, I exchanged some emails with him to learn more about his journey. His contact info is listed on his website: http://kintarowalksjapan.com . Okay. It's getting long. I should stop here. I've embedded the Google video below. Enjoy!  http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3067683435545761102&hl=enI hope you'll watch it and share with me what you thought about it.

   So nice to meet you here. It's my first diary. In order to improve my English, I have to remember many new words every day.But it doesn't make my English have great progress.Then I resorted to my workmate, sophie, she told me that I could join this group here. Here we get together to learn one or two languages, we can communicate in a new language. That's so good. I believe that we can all get what we need.    Because of my job, I have to master English better in a short time. So , friends, can you give me some good advice about it?   I hope to receive your replies soon.

Hi! Thanks for reading this small introduction.My name is Santiago Madrigal. I live in Bogotá (Colombia) and found out about Lang-8 in a post at tofugu.com, which is a blog about Japanese culture and learning the Japanese language. When I saw the video review of this site on that blog, I... I just found the whole concept really cool!! You write about whatever you want in your target language, and other people correct it for you. Also, you help other people with their target language by correcting their mistakes and giving advice. An almost perfect give-receive language system!!SO, given that I REALLY want (and need!) to polish up my English writing skills before tackling my Japanese with more dedication, I decided to stop thinking about mayyyybe joining somedayyyyy, and actually joined yesterday at night. So... here I am. Ready to write about the most random stuff I can come up with, willing to receive help from you people, and also very very willing to help all of you that are currently learning Spanish.So... yeah... be MERCILESS with your corrections!!! >:D

Hello folks,First of all, nice to meet you. I am Smiley Cheryl from Southern China. By chance I settled down here. Lang-8 still is a mysterious place for me to explore. Maybe under your guidance I can get familar with this place soon. By the way, I am an English learner and I am crazy about learning this language. The pity is that I just learn by self. So the unavoidable errors seems here and there. Especially the grammatical mistakes annoy me so much. Hey, how do you like learning English Language? And would you like to share your precious experiences with me? I am in the full conviction that your experience and wisdom can be my treasure. You know sharing and receiving is kind of happiness. It's a good way to be happier by sharing thoughts with others, don't you think so? Learning a language is a permanent project. How many people can master a language flawlessly? It's hard! Are you going to be a language specialist? Or a linguist? I am sure that's not your purpose. Maybe you intent to learn this language for getting a better life. Nevertheless, its better to keep at it!~Please give me your hand with my limited English. Thanks in advance.Let's help one another.

Hello. I'm Michiko &am a Japanese. In Japan, We have a interesting proverb '名は体を表す' Na ha Tai wo Arawasu. It means Names and Natures do often agree. Or Name is omen.Recently, I found such a article in BBC news. Children's names 'spell trouble'Some names have good or bad associationsJordan, K'tee, Kloe and Bobbi-Jo are all names to make some teachers' hearts sink, apparently.Teachers have confessed to making snap judgements about children from their names on the register.In a light-hearted debate on a teachers' website, they have listed the names they associate with problematic and charming pupils.Poppys are seen as hyperactive, Kayleighs as a pain and Ryans as hard work, according to chat on the website of the Times Educational Supplement.Kyle, Liam, Wayne, Charmaine and Charlie are among the names teachers say they associate with problem children.One teacher wrote: "I went through my new class list and mentally circled the ones I thought would be difficult. I reckon I have a 75% hit rate..." Good listKate, Gregory, Sean, Charlotte, Jamie, Daniel, Lucy, Isobel, Ben, Sam, Harpreet, Imran, Asam, Alice and JosephAccording to the website, names which get a negative response from teacher include those with hyphens, like Bobbi-Jo, ordinary names with unusual spellings such as Kloe or K'tee, Kristopher, Jayne, Gyaike and Chevaughn, plus the various spellings of Jordon.Names which teachers associate with delightful children include Kate, Gregory, Sean, Charlotte, Jamie, Daniel, Lucy, Isobel, Ben, Sam, Harpreet, Imran, Asam, Alice and Joseph.However, perhaps proving that one's response to a name is dependent on one's personal experience, many names appear on both lists. Bad listBobbi-Jo, Kloe, K'tee, Kristopher, Jayne, Wayne, Charlie, Liam, RyanThe debate has sparked a row with parents chatting on another website, bounty.com.Some were appalled, complaining that children were being labelled and pre-judged before they had even stepped inside a classroom.One mother said she had complained to the Department for Education and Skills, saying: "I and many other parents are disgusted by the attitudes of the teachers on the forum."I realise this is a small number of teachers, but they have taken time out of their day to post these comments and I presume... they actually mean what they are saying."But others on the site sympathised with the teachers, saying they understood how if you had had a bad experience with a child, their name would continue to have bad associations for you.I have a similar experience as the article.When I was a student, our part time job co-workers talked about most of 'Kobayashi' are quiet and strict character. (Kobayashi means a Japanese common sir name.) I agreed it since my Kobayashi san are quiet,too! lolAnyway, Of course, It's silly you judge just their name. But I can understand vaguely that a name has some tendency...Guys, what do you think?!I wanna know your opinion!Thanks!

Now a festival of my university is being held, and my club is joining it by offering a target practice game using bows and arrows of archery.I'm a manager of the attraction, so I have worked to make it succeed.I found it puzzled to manage a event or a program efficiently without generating a free rider.The event is not free, so we earn a lot of money. The money we earn is distributed to the team members, who work as a reception or a clerk. Whether earning money or not is an important point, for a manner of a worker can change by it.Most of members of the team have done well, but some of them make problems, and make me frustrated.The worst thing that make me angry was that one of my colleages tore and throw away a paper on which I wrote what to do in the event. He might have done it as a joke, but I couldn't help feel extremely bad. I felt my effort treated as a trash, too.Feeling so, I understood that a manager must not be emotional on such a situation. I should calm down, always make my mind cool to make the best decision. How can I face to an emotional frustration? I am not  a Buddha but a human, so I cannot help being irritated when something bad happens. I have tried some ways to refrain this feeling: breathe deeply, imagine "I am a robot and I don't feel anything," or escape to the fantasic world by reading a novel of Galcia Marquez. But I think I should supress a bad feeling as soon as possible.Does anyone know the way? I want to be more optimistic.p.s. At the same time I thank to this situation, for I cannot learn how to manage "real" people by reading textbooks or attending to lectures of the university. I understand the theoretical answer, but it is far from being enough yet.I'm sorry that I wrote a gloomy, depressing  journal. I think this diary will depress a reader as much as an article written about a falling economy.

Hi!Recently my parents have told me that they are planing to move to Seattle, so I`ve decided to improve my language skills.I`m not sure that if I was in english-speaking country I`ll understand all the words and phrases...And I`m still having problems with grammar...Actually,nobody knows about my parent`s plan and I`m quite scared of it...So, I guess, I need to talk about myself.My name is Liza and I`m 15 years old. I live in Russia, in Saint-Petersburg. It`s a really beautiful city, I love walking down his streets and watching his buildings and museums. Maybe it`s not that common, but I love some cultural things. I find them quite interesting.Well, I`m studing english for 8 year and I love this language. From the October 2009 I`ve started to learn Japanese... And for the 3 years I`m studing French. I`m still not so good at that language and I`m going to study it in the summer by myself.If you`re learning russian language I can help you. So you`re always welcome with questions!=D

I had a ensemble lesson today.  There were many kids with violin, and I thought if I had started violin this age, I would play it well.Those children were so cute.I watched a Swiss movie, "My piano concerto".(The original title might be "VITUS".) This movie wom many awards.  A genius boy who has abilities of piano and mathmatics helps his grandfather and his father with unbelievable ways, but he feels difficulties because of his talent.I thought this movie was interesting.

I've decided to start using this site to improve my English today.That's why this is my first post.I'm totally not sure what I should write about... Maybe I should find something readers can have an interest from my daily life.Today, I watched the movie named School of Rock starring Jack Black and Joan Cusack.  As a matter of fact, I have a DVD of this movie so it was a second time to see this movie. However still I was able to enjoy it.If you love rock music, you might want to see this movie.In this movie, Led Zeppelin's famous song, 'Immingrant song' was used. I heard it was a first time that Led Zeppelin allowed someone to use their song in a movie.Anyway, I enjoyed this movie.Thanking you in advance for taking a time to read this post!

Hi everyone, this is my first entry, and I will talk about why do I learn English.I took my first English classes when I was 6 years old. My mother has enrolled me in a out of school activity like she did with my big brother. I don't remember a lot of things about these classes, except about my school teacher "Suzy" and that I really enjoyed to take these courses.After that, I took English classes at school like all of child but I never lost my passion for this language. When I was 14 (approximativly), I watched one of my first serial in english, it was "Charmed", this american serial with 3 witches. Do you remember about it? Since that date, I can't stand to watch a serial except than its original version.From now on, I want to improve my english because I need it in my future job, I work in computer programming and a lot of thing is in english. But I also want to make an international career that's why I need to improve my english because I make a lot of conjugation and grammar mistakes. I will stop there I think you got my main reasons about writing here.See you soon all and thank you for reading

Teacher is a kind of career which is respected by others. When we retrospect what we experienced during our studying in schools, we can easily find that teachers exactly play crucial roles in our everyday studying. Under my teachers’ help, I raise from an ignorant girl to a college student who are full of various knowledge. Teachers always patiently instruct knowledge to us; they not only own full of specialty knowledge but own passion that nutrient next generations.

The meaning of the singing from migratory birds.I often hear Chinese geese singing in the sky in the early morning. Today I heard them singing again while they were flying to the habitat for winter season. They must have flown through the whole night. How tired they are. The singing seems to come from the long journey. Their singing cheer themselves each other. Maybe they are talking about their destination from the night flight. Where is the destination? The leader or elders would answer like this, Not far, it's so near. I thought to myself like this.This is my first diary to learn English composition.

I think this module helps is aimed to teach students how to prepare and plan their learning, performance and desired achievement. It is designed to make sure that students can have a better preparation so that they can gain as much as they can from this module. It provides students reflect on their personal, education and helps students learn how to development they better in the future. After attending all the lectures of this module I learned a lot. WHAT I HAVE LEARNEDAfter learning this module, the clearest thing what I learned is the awareness about my own personal development has been improved. Before the studying I did not really care about personal development. I even did not think about it at all. What is more, I learned how to prepare for my own studying and life. One of the most useful things for my daily life I learned is time management. I think I can manage my time much better than before. I set my priorities, wrote diary lists, have an everyday followed time patterns and also have some mini-goals for each steps. This is one of the evidence what I did for my time management. It helped me to clearly see what I have to do every day for each time. I did things much more efficiency. I also learned many ways of notes taking. There is what I did when I writing an essay before. Many knowledge and skills I have learned. For example, I learned research skills, writing for different audiences/ reports, essays, presentations and incorporation of IT, Critical evaluation, soft skills and employability and so on. CHAGED VIEWS OF MINEI thought we do not need to prepare for the lecture in university. I thought the lecture was as boring as the lecture in my high school. In china, in high school, we have a steady format which is teacher is speaking on the stage and students only copy the things he wrote on backboard. I thought we only need to review the knowledge we learned from class when we back home. While, all of those views changed after this module. Preparation is very important for lecture, especially for foreigner students. It helped us easier to understand the knowledge. The language problem would not stop me understanding the lecturer. At the same time, after preparation I knew the important point clearer. Moreover, the way of teaching is total different form the lecture in high school in China. We did not to copy teacher’s writing. The only thing we have to do is taking note. While taking all of the things I heard is not very necessary. On the other hand, only the knowledge I studied in class is not enough, I not only have to review the knowledge learned from class, but also have to learn more after class by ourselves.  So some of mine views have been changed since learned this module. GOOD FOR MY FUTURE PERSONAL DEVELOPMENTI do think this module is helpful for my personal development. I do really think some of the knowledge is really good for my future work and life. I hope I can use the knowledge efficiency in future work and life. I hope in one day, in my work, when I have some difficult problem, then suddenly I remember this module told me what I can do at this time. It is my expectations for the future. However, sometimes when I am studying in the university, it seems like the knowledge does not make big sense, while I am definitely sure that I will find some of the knowledge is very useful in my future in one day. Furthermore, I think manager is a good type of work for me. Opening my own company is my biggest dream. I think it might be reconciled with my personal values. I think I have the characteristics of a good manager, such as great planner, filofax user, psion organisers, and schedulers. I see changes as another exciting challenge. I do not the life always the same, and I do not like the work which is no any changes. I will feel so bored nothing changed. On the other side, changes give me more motivation.SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTSI think in the future lecture, we may try one or two activities, such as visiting companies. It could be made to make the module more useful for students. If students only listen the lecture in university, it is a little bit limited, while going to an existing company could be more directly learning way. I hope in future’s lecture, I can learn more knowledge about how manage time more efficiency because I am a little bit weak about this part while it is very important for my future life. What is more, in my opinion, there is some way for the module to help students have better awareness about their personal development. For example, show some good personal development example to students, asking them to come to the lecture could be a very good effect way. To sum up, I think after learning this module, learned a lot. I understood the concept and process of continuing professional development, and how it applies to undergraduate study and beyond. I understood the self-development process, as applied to my study. I hope I can continue learning knowledge from this module and use the knowledge very well in the future.

One of the games children played when I was child is called "matagente", which is a kind of dodgeball. It's played with a group of people and a designated couple that flanks them. The couple passes the ball each other, trying to hit the people between them. When they hit a person, he/she goes out of play. The last person left wins the game.Another game popular on that age (specially among girls) is jacks ("yases" in Peru). Here, we play with six jacks. The player throws a rubber ball and takes the jacks before the ball makes more than one bounce. First, one takes the jacks one by one, later two by two, and so on, until take the six jacks in one move. Later, one plays again one by one, but with additional actions: banging on the floor before taking the jack, taking in two steps, taking without even a ball bounce, or a combination of these and others.

I don't remember how many times I decided to improve my english skills,not only the reading,but the speaking,maybe that is because I have very few times to use my poor oral english.And when I have the chance to speak,I don't know what I should say or how to organize the words,even forget what the words i want to say.That is also happened to my company i worked,our structure changed again,but luckly,there seems no effect on me,well,we still have a little unhappy,because something changed.I hate change,but i can do nothing to my dear friends and to my works.

I'll talk to you about one of my job/hobbyI'm an illustrator which means I make artwork to sell and survive in this life. In order to complete an illustration from the beginning to the end, I work  with 50/50 traditional and digital items. Traditional ones are : a big sketch block +  0.5 automatic blue pencil + 0.5 automatic pencil. In the other hand, digital items are: a cheap scanner + Corel Painter 11 or Photoshop CS3 (depending on my mood and the brushes I need to get the work done) and finally, my beloved wacom tablet.I won't tell you about the whole process of creating an image from 0 to 100 because that is a story for another entry , wait and see, dear audience, wait and see ;) This entry concerns something that, somehow, surprised me some time ago and I noticed that the tip of my penmouse is running out(?) !! I bought my brand new wacom tablet 4 years ago and I thought the penmouse would last FOREVER. How wrong I was, I wish you could see it by yourself but my digicam doesn't have macro shot system . I'll be buying a new penmouse this coming friday and I'll be happy once again.PS: In case you're wondering what the heck is a "wacom tablet and penmosue", I attached a picture for you.Thank you for reading (and correcting me)

Out lineMain Idea : My name1. My korean name- 함동훈, Ham Dong Hoon2. Name in Chinese - 咸東勳3. The meaning of name- 함 is last name, 동 means the east, 훈 means shiny.- The person who shine at the east.My korean name is 함동훈 (Ham Dong Hoon). I can change my name into Chinese which can be written like '咸東勳'. My grandmother give this name to my parents. *In general, korean name has certain meaning. In my name, 함(咸) is last name, 동(東) means the east, 훈(勳) means shiny. therefore,My name means the person who shine at the east(Korea). So, I try to be a man who suit this name.

So, I'm sorry. I think I have forgotten to introduce myself just because the question bothers me.Well, my name is Lena, I'm from Russia, 20 years old. Love music, travelling, playing the harp, talking, reading books.I don't think I'm speaking about something really interesting, because I think almost everyone can say the same about himself (despite of the harp may be;)).So I can say I'm awful daughter of my country, not make the profit for it, but as many young people hates Russia, I can say I really love it. This country has sooo many problems in economics, politics, in social life especially, but what county doesn't? Every county has its own problem. Problems are different and problems are not the reason for hating your own country.So why I'm saying I'm not a good daughter of my country. May be because I'm doing nothing at home now, when I should study my C# course (it's the programming language). May be becasue I really hate my future speciality and don't want to be a programmist (I'm the one of that persons who go to university just to get diploma). Russia needs smart young people, who will help it to wake up in the future, but I can't say I'm one of them. I'm just living my life. And I can't say I love the way I live.It's time to change something, but I really don't know what I should change first. Please, don't offer hair cut, I'm trying to let my hair grow:))Well, I think there is no interesting things in my monologue (or there is?:)), so I'll finish.I just want to say my dream is to learn French language. But as I don't see why French is needed for me (may be just to listen french version of Notre Dame de Paris musical without subtitles), it's just a dream. May be I will learn it someday.Bye bye.  Love you all!:)

Hi! I am a student, and I attend addition English courses. I am good in English to Russian translation. There is a big trouble for me - translate Russian texts into English. Help me, please, check my homework, and explain my mistakes."You can tell about art only by showing art. This occurrence happened in the life of the famous Russian opera singer Feodor Ivanovich Chaliapin (1873 - 1938). A few actors debate about the question, what is art. Chaliapin quietly went to another room. Suddenly the door opened, he stood on the threshold of mortally pale, with disheveled hair, trembling lips, with eyes full of horror and said: "Fire!". There are panic, someone was screaming ... But Chaliapin suddenly burst out laughing: "Now do you understand what art is?!" The artists had no doubt on fire started when they saw emotional shock expression on the Chaliapin’s face, which appears on the face of the participant of an emergency, on their experience."It's a quotation from one book. I have been translated it from Russian into English.

The world is coming to an end. Have you ever realized that? The continual conflicts mostly in developing countries, the huge amount of people suffering from poverty or dying of malnutrition and the really serious problem that is global warming. All these terrible situations are the problems that the earth and international community are facing. If there would be a way of solution, it would be the creation of a world government. By creating a world government would be the best way to create a world order and bring peace to the world. The idea of the creation of a world government appeared when World War Ⅱ ended. The miserable atomic bomb was dropped on Japan and it showed the world what an atomic bomb can do which was all nations can be destroyed, easily. It was then the international community began to think about creating a united government to control the atomic power. In this research paper, it will be indicated the situation the world is in and what we can do to fix it up. In the first, it will be a section about the reasons for a world government. Next, we will go through the history of the development of the world government. At the end, it will be discussed on the problems with the world government working effectively and how to make it work better.​     The international community has forgotten what is happening in the developing countries. Above all, Afghanistan is in a really sirius situation.  And war is all that Afghanistan's children only know. According to the UNCHR, there are about 15.2 million people existing as refugee around the world, of which 20% that is 2.88 million people is said to have come from Afghanistan (2009 Global Trends). The lost country’s economic power, due to the war, has fallen to the lowest in the world. The war in Afghanistan has destroyed everything especially opportunities of education which contributes the essential components of the country. The national literacy rate is only 28%. In addition, the literacy rate goes less than 5% for women in rural areas. Looking at the situations of children, one out of four loses their precious lives by the time they got to five. In a 1997 UNICEF survey, children who experienced or witnessed or, actually, received act of violence during the war is reported to be close to 70% of the all researched amount. There were many poor villages where people’s children had to put out as soldiers in order to obtain food and be able to eat, during the war. Such children, in fact, need the opportunity of education, and it is important that they should be given the environment where they can essentially grow up just like children all over the world, in order to return to the society and contribute to the country’s success in the future. However, an international volunteer association called Shanti (SVA), has reported that there is no text book in Afghanistan while more than 5,000 schools are required, teachers who have received a higher education are only 15%, and to not to increase the generation that cannot receive a normal education, it is an emergency task to obtain the assistance, that is needed, from the international community.(to be continued)

RioAn interesting movie has a very simple story line. It's easy to follow and enjoy it. Giving the animals man-like behaviors is the part I love most. It's hard to believe they make so many man's face in a dog or bird. But they did it. Some idea surprised me so much. Especial the idea the dog helps them to cut the chain. I just confused how can the editors thought out such a brilliant idea. I am very sure there must be a idea tank. They save the idea when it flash in their mind. If they can use them in a single movie, they can leave it for the next one.I believe even a great writer can not image a story totally isolate for the reality world. Based on such viewpoint, I always moving by such movie which show us the good side of human-being. Without the friends' help, Blue absolutely can not achieve such a happy live with the girl he loves. Best wishes for the couples who love each other so much.

In 2 months, I'll be back home. Not for long, because I'm heading to Ireland a few weeks after.At some points I got sort of sick of China, everything was annoying me, the people, the behavior, the language, the food... It was a kind of sign that I needed to go home. Now I'm good again, I like China, people are nice, etc. :DA strange thing happened to me too, I usually hate French songs. I really do, but being away from home made me wanna listen to it.I was in the subway the other day, listening to Jacques Brel (Ok, ok, I'm not really up-to-date, he's an old singer) and I really became homesick.I was listening to "Le plat pays" (The flat land). It's a song describing my country, Belgium. My whole life, I only thought about running away from Belgium, discovering the world, living in exciting places and all but still. At that point, I wanted to jump in a plane and be at home, with my grey sky, my green garden, the little spring we have in the back of the garden, the ponds, the flowers.etc.I know that once there, I'll only think of getting out again though !I've also been nostalgic thanks to "The road to home" from Amy McDonalds, you should listen to those 2 !Anyway, "Le plat pays" is, I think, the best description of Belgium ever, so I wanted to share it with others ! It's a poem in French, quite hard to understand actually (even for French-speakers I mean, like me !), he plays with words.Avec la mer du Nord pour dernier terrain vagueWith the North See as a last wasteland,Et des vagues de dunes pour arrêter les vaguesand waves of dunes to stop the waves,Et de vagues rochers que les marées dépassentand indistinct rocks which the tides overrunEt qui ont à jamais le cœur à marée basseand whose hearts forever remain at low ebb...Avec infiniment de brumes à venirWith an infinity of mists to come...Avec le vent de l'est écoutez-le tenirWhen the wind is from the East, listen how it fights -Le plat pays qui est le mienthis flat land of mine... Avec des cathédrales pour uniques montagnesWith cathedrals for sole mountains,Et de noirs clochers comme mâts de cocagneand black church-steeples for may-poles,Où des diables en pierre décrochent les nuageswhere devils of stone grope for the clouds...[the gargoyles you can find on top of churches]Avec le fil des jours pour unique voyageWith the succession of days as its only journeyEt des chemins de pluie pour unique bonsoirand rain-drenched roads as its only goodnight...[it rains very often in Belgium, like 360days out of 365 !]Avec le vent d'ouest écoutez-le vouloirWhen the wind is from the West, listen how it pines -Le plat pays qui est le mienthis flat land of mine... Avec un ciel si bas qu'un canal s'est perduWith a sky so low that a canal has got lost,[in Belgium, the typical color of the sky is greyish, like the color of water]Avec un ciel si bas qu'il fait l'humilitéwith a sky so low that it fakes humility,Avec un ciel si gris qu'un canal s'est penduwith a sky so grey that a canal has hanged himself,[the grey sky is kind of depressing]Avec un ciel si gris qu'il faut lui pardonnerwith a sky so grey that he must be forgiven...Avec le vent du nord qui vient s'écartelerWhen the Northern gales come blasting down...Avec le vent du nord écoutez-le craquerWhen the wind is from the North... listen how it creaks -Le plat pays qui est le mienthis flat land of mine... Avec de l'Italie qui descendrait l'EscautWith a touch of Italy flowing down the Schelde,[= reference to all the Italian immigrants in Belgium]Avec Frida la Blonde quand elle devient Margotwhen Frieda the Fair turns into Margot[= mix of culture :it means when a Flemish girl(Frieda) plays "Margot" in a French play; we all interact together in Belgium OR frigid Frieda when she becomes a "femme fatale"]Quand les fils de novembre nous reviennent en maiwhen the sons of November return to us in May,[written in 1961, the military service was 18months. Usually it started in November and ended in May 2 years later OR the migrant workers unemployed from Nov to May]Quand la plaine est fumante et tremble sous juilletwhen the plains smoke and tremble under July,[in Belgium, July and August are the hottests, he's talking about the big plains characteristic of Belgium; "trembe" because of the heat and the harvest time]Quand le vent est au rire, quand le vent est au bléwhen the wind is to laughter, when the wind is to wheat,[laughter = time to relax; to wheat : time to work]Quand le vent est au sud, écoutez-le chanterwhen the wind is from the South, listen how it sings -Le plat pays qui est le mien.this flat land of mine...I'm done !

your correction will probably help me find a job, so thanks a lot :pObject: application for an internship - labor lawyer Dear Hiring Manager,Actually in a Labor law Master 2 and holder of a language culture and business of Japan Master 2, I’m allowing myself to send to you this application because working for Nissan would offer the exciting framework of a company at the edge of innovation, a quality reflected in your social relationships. The prospect of learning with you to face the legislation and social challenges of an audacious firm, who bet on human diversity, this is particularly motivating Convinced of the importance of the challenge posed by the labor law between society, I joined a law degree in addition to my first Master course and then chose the law school for my exchange year in Japan. In this experiment, through the encounter of the different actors of the working world, I could see other social practices and I went back convinced  of the need for mutual understanding to manage effective and fair legal management  of working relationships which are now globalized. Determined to put this experience in movement through the practice of social law in a multicultural environment, I completed my education with a master's bringing me the solid knowledge necessary for the lawyer profession. My  unique dual skill combined with my energy, adaptability, writing ability  and rigor of reasoning, qualities manifested throughout my cursus, will, I hope, be helpful for this internship.Our collaboration would last between 4 and 6 months and could start as early as April, in France or elsewhere. Finally, noting that any proposal that allows you to use my double qualification would make our work more productive, I remain at your disposal and would welcome the oportunity to discuss together about this application. Sincerly,

The Spanish Civil War was a conflict between republicans and nationalists.The rebellion started on July 17, 1936 in Morocco. The day after, the rebellion continued in the Iberian Peninsula.The first objective of nationalists was to take up Madrid and win the war quickly. Nationalists couldn't to take up Madrid because republicans resisted with help of URSS. Then, nationalists tried to cut off Madrid. Nationalists lost the “Batalla del Jarama” and “Batalla de Guadalajara” in 1936.URSS and French helped republicans with International Brigades and tanks called, T-24.Mussolini helped nationalists with tanks called “Fiat Ansaldo”. Hitler too helped nationalists with a terrible troop called Condor Legion.The next objective of nationalists was to take up the north of Spain. The Condor Legion bombed Gernika, and Picasso painted it.Spain was divided in half, so Nationalists began the attack of the Mediterraneo to cut off the republic zone in 1938.Republicans knew that they were losing then they began the battle of the Ebro. Republicans army was massacred and nationalists army could to take up all Catalonia.Republican zone didn't have aliments and the people was hungry.In April of 1939 nationalists won the war and, they took up all Spain without resistence.

Besides, I'd love to receive a little bit of feedback about what I'm going to say, and also, corrections because I'm never sure if my grammar is correct.The thing is that I've been feeling really sad and confused today. The reason? I basically lost my motivation to learn French.This isn't new for me, I've been feeling like this since March. I really don't know why, I find the classes really boring and annoying, also, the book we use in class doesn't help either. I can't concentrate enough and the only reason why I keep attending to my classes is because I like to be with my friends.At first, I thought I was having a hard time because we're learning a lot of heavy grammar, I tried to stay positive and forget about it, but now...Now I realized this isn't about the grammar or something like that. I remember that a few months ago my mom saw me studying Japanese in the kitchen and she noticed I was in a really good mood. I finished my homework a half an hour later and I started with my french homework and I instantly got frustrated, so my mom asked me what was wrong.I told her that french was giving me a hard time because of the grammar,the book wasn't good and my teacher was always asking us to do a lot of letters and I was running out of ideas. Besides, she criticized my letters because they were apparently "too long", so she told me to do shorter letters. When I started to do my letters a little bit shorter, she told me that they weren't good enough. So I basically didn't know what to do.Another thing is that, I'm already a Niveau B2 (Advanced) and I had to spend 5 hours per week in french classes, but I'm not going to take the international french exam this year because I'm going to Germany in September (Exchange/Au Pair program) and I'll be staying there until next year.My french teacher noticed I'm not the same person that I used to and she said that I'm not giving my best because I'm going to Germany and I don't need to study hard to the B2 test, but I think she's wrong, because I don't feel demotivated because I'm going to Germany and my head is focused on the german language, I FEEL DEMOTIVATED BECAUSE I FEEL THAT WAY! I'd be really worried if I had to take the test this year and I find myself in this terrible situation.She also says that I'm not paying enough attention to french because I started with japanese this year, and it makes me really anrgy because you have no idea of how much enjoy studying japanese. When I go to my japanese classes I feel very relaxed, no one is pushing me...My japanese teacher doesn't like to take traditional exams (he likes to ask random questions and if you don't answer them, he tells you to study harder) and he tells us that studying japanese is something that we should do because we like it and it's not an obligation. I personally feel the same way with German and French but it's not the same thing. I've been learning German since I was really little because I went to a German school and even though I love the language and the culture, I've always had to take it REALLY serious because it was a subject in school and I've always had the pressure of the international tests (I'm not saying that someone forced to take them, I did it because I wanted to, and I'M PROUD to have the certificates and everything but I still had pressure).Same thing with French, I started because I like the language and the culture but I've always studied for exams and that stuff.On the other hand, I study japanese for pleasure. I take it seriously and I study hard, but no one is pushing me to get ready for a test or anything. I enjoy studying all the languages I'm currently studying, but French is really killing me right now, and I can't quit because I'm extremely responsible and I'd feel guilty, since I'm almost two months away of leaving my country for a year (I won't study french in Germany)I've never felt this way before, I've had hard times with German too but not like thisSorry if this was too long and boring but I had to say it to someone and since a lot of people don't understand me when I try to talk about this and judge me, I really can't talk to them...Besides people are here to learn languages and I don't know, I thought this was the proper place to talk about this...Thanks for reading :-)

Today I join to this website. And now I will try to find new friends and do my best in english and german learning. From my childhood I liked different foreign languages. I even thought to connect with them my future profession (to be a translator or something like that), but in on moment I decided to be a doctor.Now I have a wonderful dream. I want to study medicine in Germany. And now I study german. I have learnt it in school, but I have gotten a very poor knowledge there. Now I search my own individual programm to know german like germans =) And this livejournal and communication with other users, I think, will help me.

Good evening everybody,I have seen sumo on TV.About 3 week ago, after twist my ankle, I left to Japan.I stayed 8 days at Sapporo.Sometimes, I watched sumo at the hotel.I like sumo but it seems to be a little difficult to understand.Before fighting, sumo wrestlers do things that I don't understand.I believe the winner was japanese.He received a lot of trophy.bye.Bonsoir tout le monde,J'ai vu du sumô à la télé.Il y a environ 3 semaines, après m'être fait une entorse, je suis parti au Japon.J'ai séjourné 8 jours à Sapporo.Parfois, je regardais le sumo à l'hôtel.J'aime le sumô, mais ça semble compliqué.Avant de se battre, les lutteurs font des choses que je ne comprend pas.Le vainqueur était japonais je crois.Il a reçu beaucoup de trophée.

In this day and age,the incidence of overweight children in developed countries hovering at a high level,many have became disturbed and alarmed.Some assert that fast food outlets should be responsible for this,while others opposite this view on the ground that they are parents who should be blamed.Personally,I deem that both sides has its merits and demerits.Granted,fast food outlets exert baneful influences on teenagers and utilizing various methods to impel youngster to buy their food for the sake of money.Firstly,these companies,by broadcasting misleading advertisements,fast food outlets send a message that eating fast food is good for your health to these immature children.Secondly,to meet the favor of the obesity teenagers,these outlets add too much fat and sugar in their food which is the chief culprit in obesity.According, without any self-discipline,it is standard practise for youngster to have these junk food all the day.However,it is erroneous if we fail to admit the negative effect exert by parents.To begin with,parents tend to be more busy with their work and care lees about their kids than a decade ago when there was few fat children.Consequently,children always eat alone without any guidance about what should eat,To fulfill their favor,obesity teenagers have a vast amount of junk food rather than health food(vegetables,cereals).Further,parents,most are unaware of the hazards of fast food,take their offsprings to fast food restaurants due to its convenience.Thus,with so many unhealthy meals,teenagers tend to be fatter and fatter.In final analysis,I concede that fast food outlets afford us these junk food exaggerating  teenagers' obesity problems to some extent.However,parents with little knowledge and less time spent with their children should also be responsible for this situation.On balance,I am convinced that both outlets and parents engender this healthy problem.

Hello! This is my first of many entries. Currently, I’m studying English in the USA. I think it’s a great opportunity to study a language in its source country, right? I’ve been studying English since 1st grade. I like people correcting my writing in Spanish and English. Usually, I use Word’s spelling check, but sometimes when you correct it the meaning of the sentence changes. So, I also like friends and other people to check it for me so I can have a different opinion about it. I really like writing in the Internet. What I normally use is Facebook and Twitter; hopefully I’ll like posting here in Lang-8 too! This is a new experience for me, because on the other WebPages I have privacy settings and only some people can read my posts; in here I hope to get as many opinions as possible to improve as much as I can.

  College life may be lonely for you now, especially when you are autistic and long for love. but never be cheated by it ,you can gain friendship in such a great circumstance ,and that may be some of your greatest possession in your life. ­  I realized this the first day I came to Guilin university of electronic technology. Yes, universities are completely different from senior high schools, but there are still some people mistaken it. they persist in the version that we should pay more attention on communication and try to find a girlfriend(boyfriend) , but not study hard. However, for us majoring in electronic information engineering, it is wrong. I'd admit that social intercourse is essential, but being proficient at your major is also of great significance. ­  For me, I've ever lost my heart to a girl when in senior high school, but what I don't know is that she had already fell in love with another boy, now, things all gone, but I can still get some reminiscences.­  From that , I learned to go myself. I've been sad at that time though, today, I am, to be honest, still happy, 'cause I enjoy parental love, friendship and study thought no love(maybe I have never own love,that's merely unrequited love) ­  In college, owning love is best ,being lonely is also great. if you still remain single, try to live yourself, try to care about everyone you want , 'cause you have no scruple. ­You see! your roommate is asleep, isn't he very cute? Look around your campus, it's really beautiful!…… ­Is life wonderful? Yes! though lonely without love, you actually own much. ­Just remember, no love for loneliness! when it comes, it comes!­

There is serious occasion to pay attention of the public to question of lessons of computer literacy for first-graders. At many schools acquaintance to information technology begins already in elementary school. This innovation has called storm of discussions as not all experts look at this question equally. Certainly, positive sides of this project are indisputable. Namely, nobody doubts that any schoolboy is obliged to be able to work with the computer, receiving the certificate about education. Information technologies supersede out-of-date things.However, there is underside of project. Numerous researches of last years show that about 25-30 % of children, coming to the first classes, have those or other deviations in state of health; among graduates school already more than 80 % it is impossible to name absolutely healthy.Experts-physicians notice the disturbing tendency of deterioration of physical health of children all at earlier age. Here affect both inactive way of life, and lack of games in the open air, and long sitting behind desk or the computer. Besides, necessity to consider small objects at a short distance from eye negatively influences sight of the child.Furthermore, there are also psychological problems. If it is a question of the child, the serious control from outside parents behind the maintenance of games and orientation of sites which the child visits on the Internet is necessary. It is necessary to protect completely the child from malicious and severe games. But even if game or the program is focused on age of the kid, it is impossible to start simply it on the computer and to leave the child from it alone. Even the best computer games and programs do life one-sided, and development defective.

Last week I was horrible busy and went home almost around 10 p.m. everyday, so I have no time to study any German. Anyway as an employee, I have been always trying to solve my working stuffs firstly. And actually I worked hard and I really hope I can get some kinds of promotion. But after 5 years’ hard working, now it seems more and more impossible. Perhaps I have chosen the wrong beginning at first step. In this company, all the leaders are Germans, and all the Chinese are only the side food. I still have not really made this issue clear until this week I had a small divergence with my manager and then he used a kind of dictator‘s way to suppress me. I have already encountered the glass ceiling of my career but I have been so long time not aware of that, until I found that I only can do the routine and boring works day by day. I am not even 29. This is definitely not what I have expected. As like most people, when I graduated from the Uni, I made a plan for my first 5 years. And then I was trying to make 1 year plan. But all the plans like my New Year‘s resolution, none of them have been realized. I have been grown mature and more considerate, but on the other hand, I have not made any achievements in any further study, like my German, because I always have this or that excuse for my absence of study everyday.  I hope it is still not too late for me to make a change. When I was in Uni., I used to like one poem very much. This poem is full of passions and courage. I hope I can always possess this kind of courage, and never be afraid of changing, never quit in frond of difficulties. Below is the poem: The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost 　　Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, 　　And sorry I could not travel both 　　And be one traveler, long I stood 　　And looked down one as far as I could 　　To where it bent in the undergrowth; 　　Then took the other, as just as fair, 　　And having perhaps the better claim, 　　Because it was grassy and wanted wear; 　　Though as for that the passing there 　　Had worn them really about the same, 　　And both that morning equally lay 　　In leaves no step had trodden black. 　　Oh, I kept the first for another day! 　　Yet knowing how way leads on to way, 　　I doubted if I should ever come back. 　　I shall be telling this with a sigh 　　Somewhere ages and ages hence: 　　Two roads diverged in a wood,and I— 　　I took the one less traveled by, 　And that has made all the difference.

Mrs Stone had spent the whole morning cooking. It was nearly lunch time, so she decided to pick some blackberries to accompany the pudding she had prepared. She was just picking a fruit when she heard a noise in the bushes. Then she saw an animal which looked like a large cat. She knew it was not a cat because it was too large. The animal suddenly jumped and she thought it was going to attack her. She dropped her basket and shouted terrified. Hearing the sound, the animal ran away, after which, Mrs Stone picked her basket and ran all the way home. She told her neighbours that she had seen a puma but they didn't believe her. She also telephoned the police but they thought she was joking or perhaps she was a crazy woman who had had a hallucination.

To be honest,I don't know what to say.En...English is very hard for me,though I have learnt it for years.Now English is still the most important lesson(Can I use lesson?I'm not sure.)But I only learnt how to pass the examination.Millions of students in China face the same problem with me.We can't express ourself.We can't talk with others.We don't know whether I was speak American-English or Britian-English.Maybe it is just Chi-English.Studying language is hard and usefully,no....it is interesting....If you can use language,you can know another country well.To me,I like history....I want know more about European history.Who want to know Chinese history more? I think we can talk about it.Studying history is interesting.en....Thanks for reading first.Thanks for correcting my mistakes.

 Mrs Stappleton said to her husband that he looked much better and invited him to have a drink. He agreed and told her that he knew about the strange visitor they’d had that day. As he couldn’t remember meeting him before, he asked her where she knew him from.Mrs Stappleton explained that they used to have contact with his sister, called Anne Nuttle, and asked him if he remembered her. However, he denied having met her before. Mrs Stappleton exclaimed that he was always forgetting people and suggested that he should pay more attention, but he refused to accept that advice and boasted about having a very good memory. Mrs Stappleton reminded him that the girl used to work in the rectory about four years ago. He said that he was sorry and admitted not remembering her.Finally, Mrs Stappleton told him that the lady’s brother had been there going through a cure for his nerves. She supposed that that was the reason why he acted in such a way; they both thought he really looked disturbed, especially when he ran out of the house. At the end, Mrs Stappleton invited her husband to talk about his day.

There are some people in this world that seem to think that money is the most important aim in life. It is not exact.We need money to pay medicine for our mother, for our nephew or for our grandmother. With money we can buy food for homeless animals and we can save their life bringing them to veterinary, as some do often. We can also pay our fees, our aliments, and our basic needs.We can also buy some material, but spiritual goods as books, movies, songs. We can pay a ticket to go to see nice movie at cinema about love or about life. We can enjoy moving representation in theater paying the ticket for. Also, appreciate nice music at concerts when we go there. (may be also opera, but I like only the famous ones)We can as well have the chance to make some trips and visit extraordinary beautiful places in this world that will conquer our soul. We can be touched by some miracles of the wild (and not so wild) nature, and of course, meet some new, strange and probably nice persons, very different from us.But there are some curious persons in this world that seem absolutely obnubilated by money. The main reason of their lives is to have more and more money. They love drive luxe sport cars (and not one, but many), love pay expensive items and accessoiries.  They ignore persons, and ignore their family.Money is for them the only reason to live.But it is not. Reason to live can be to awake happy in room where someone comes to kiss you for good morning. To have a home where everyone shares a smile and laugh at table, where your heart feels light without reason because you have with you those that you love and that love you the most. Those that you will cry the day they have to leave forever this earth.

Today was a really busy day. Last night I went to sleep around 3 am. I am a kind of computer geek, so I know how to make documents using Latex, a program to make academic writings. So I was helping a friend that had problems with her master thesis, and was the last day before the deadline. I am working as a part-time programmer in a Japanese company. I start working at 10:00, but I spent one hour by train from home. So I have to get up at 7:00 to get at time to work.So I slept about 4 hours but I was sleepy all day. Anyway, one day closer to Friday!

A sense of loneliness encouraged me to take a train and go to rural areas. To purge myself of stressful works, I walked along the river and jotted down a diary, recalling the past days. I find I get increasingly attached to things of the past. All the time I attempt to put the future and goals before the things that have gone, not to be stuck in the history. However, I found men have their own traits that never chane. That's why I repeat the same behaviors and thoughts.

Several years ago famous mathematician Arnold refused to enter Popes academy because they did not justify Jordano Bruno.They told him that religion does not argue with science about what science could proof, but when something is not known, or could not be known to science they are in power to decide what to think about that, and so Bruno thought that there are many worlds with life on those worlds and that was a heresy, and stayed heresy until recently.Now Vatican tells us that aliens does not confront with orthodox.Does that mean that they got scientific proof of an alien being true or they have some serious reason to think that this is true?

Hi there! Recently I started using lang-8 and find it so much addictive, specially if you are bored at work like me right now. The thing is there are no customers, and that is because February is not a very touristic month I guess. I work with foreign tourists and sadly I think today will be like yesterday, I mean youtube, reading some books and so on... (you might think that is fabulous specially if you get paid for doing nothing but believe me it's so boring...)But today I have some work to do, I need to write a letter to apply for a governmental grant and I can't find the moment to start it... Even if someone appeared just to say hello it would be easier to be on (how do you express to be active? to start the day?)... And,,, the hardest thing is the coffee machine is off... :P

When you are in school, you will not surprise to find that boys always tend to favor science while girls choose liberal arts. Thus a kind of interesting phenomena is engendered. We often call science classes the monks' classes, for there are so many boys that girls become "rare species"; and arts classes are called the nuns' classes for the similar reason. Taking it for granted already, we seldom think why it happens. Are we born to be like this; or do we develop it postnatally?It is the common sense that our brains divide into two parts: the left and the right. According to a science report, the left brain is the brain of language, which means rational and logical; the right brain is the brain of image, which means emotional and intuitive. Most of the men use the left brain much more frequently than the right, hence they have the advantages over abstract thoughts, such as science and analysis. To women, the left and the right brain can be worked together that makes them do well in handcraft, social intercourse, language expressing, etc. Therefore, it is no more difficult to explain the phenomenon. If you want to question that boys can also be good at liberal arts and girls at science, I will not deny it. Of course everything has exception. However, the difference between men and women exists in general.With the development of liberty and democracy, the social structure has gradually changed. Women get more and more deserved right through incessant struggles. They begin to ask for being treated as equally as men. So this phenomenon has profound influence on the society nowadays. Instead of men for work and women for housework, women are emerging in every field of work. Especially in the fields of language, service, education and so on, which demand high quality of patience, carefulness and the power of expression, women have already taken a great part even the lead in them. On the contrary, we still see little women working in the fields of science and technology. It is the new trend that men and women will shoulder a half of the society. For that reason, the social policies must be reformed to better adapt this change. Maternity leave is one of the typical cases.    Speaking of the differences between men and women, I have interviewed some students in our campus. And we shared a variety of opinions. They say that men deal with matter more sensibly while women often act impetuously. In love affairs, men might pay more attention to the aspect of sex than women. If men are compared to living in realistic world, women may believe in romanticism and idealism. All in all, behavior difference is based on physiological difference. How men and women using brains contributes to their distinct future.

Last year we made decision to spend our holidays abroad. We went to the travel agency and agent offered to us a several good hotels and itenararies. We chose one that was optimal cost / quality. Then we filled out some papers work and recived our tour packages in that was included airfare (tickets was bought in advanced): two round-trip tickets, insurance and temporary medical policy. So we packed our rolling duffle bag with zip lock and at the appointed day and went to the Rostov airport by bus.We arrived at 12 o'clock p.m., walked through the metal detector And looked at the information desk the flight number and departure time. But boarding and flight began at about 4 o'clock a.m. We had to wait 2 or 3 hours in the waiting hall before custom control started, good film helped us to while away the time. At 2 o'clock we cleared the custom, went trough passport control, took our tickets, boarding passes and were allowed to go through the green channel. Staff of the airport weighted our luggage and we took heavy and bulky bags to the luggage van. Departure time was declared and boarding started. The flight was on time. I had window seat and Yuri had aisle seat. When we returned we sat near the emergency exit. Flight attendant asked us to do full upright position of the seat and fasten our seat belts, fligth started.Soon snacks and beverage was brought. We flew over cities and they seemed like a brigth beautiful web on a dark groud.When we arrived we went the same procedure as was in Rostov airport, but airport was bigger and more modern: elevators, big digital information desk, plants, big duty free, fountain, where the passengers thrown coin. And finnaly we were waited by travel agent who accompained to the hotel by bus. It was good hotel, all was include: meal, alcohol and entertainment. We were registred at the reception and we recived bracelets as sign belonging to this hotel. Porter showed our room and we decided to relax a little because of jet lag. We walked on air! To lay on a beach with a bocal of martini is great! The day before departure we changed rubles on lirs at the currency exchange and bought souvenirs for our relatives. It was resceduled the flight on 2 or 3 hours, and we could to have breakfast and to enjoyed sea a little more, took some pictures. Resort was passed with flying colours!

The dream begins when I was coming back from Bariloche (an excellent place for tourism), and it seemed that a big company of games development took over the world. They assigned the level -1 to every person. To be level 0 (in order to start to “play”), you should touch someone, whoever, only touch him/her... and I don’t know why the hell I wanted to be the only “normal” person, i.e. keep my level in -1. And don’t ask me why, but when people saw me they began to haunt me, just like a zombie game (check out Left 4 Dead for further information).I also remember reading the web news via PC and SMS. OK. I was on the streets and started to run. I went to my school, where I started to hit anyone who wanted to touch me, and I also remember killing some friends, more than once, and strangely they’re all always playing CS, so I could deduce they were respawning.After that I went to the kindergarten zone, where I hid under a bed. At that point, also the “president” of this “enterprise” were looking for me, because it seemed that I was the last person with the -1 level. Then, a girl that I barely know, deduced that I was under the bed (this was simplified, she actually said something like “well, the guitar is above de wardrobe, and they always ‘save’ the bass under the bed so he should be there”). Then I got up and I started laughing (like Light Yagami when the detectives team discover he’s Kira), and I said, it’s true, that’s me. The president didn’t believe in my words so I started to run again. When I got out the school I entered into a dark forest, pretty simmilar to the Forbidden Forest). I kept running and I entered to my grandma’s house, where –I don’t know why- I needed to jump a wall like a ninja, and the neighbors were waiting me in the other side, and hell, I started to run again. I appeared in a known avenue, I kept running for a few blocks and I saw my mom calling me from far away. When I approached she told me that a neighbor died or something, I didn’t pay much attention, but I greeted her, so hello, level 0.After that, via SMS, they advised me that I should destroy a building (or a castle) with a single kick in order to be level 1. I don’t know how I made it and from now on I didn’t remember so much, only that when I became level 2, I grow up a lot (actually I was a gigant in my opinion), and I also remember that a gigant armor (pretty simmilar to the Saint Seiya’s Gold Armors) fell directly to my body, and I heard a guy that was on my left asking “what’s this shit?”, and when I saw him he was dressed like a Digimon.

After having been working in Japan for more than two years, i am really tired from my present job. When i was still in the colleage, i supposed working as an engineer was just doing something purely and there was no need to deal with the trivial things. But after i joined in my company, i found i was totally wrong.In my department, i have to connect with the customers to confirm the specification of the product, i have to make all the  documents which are necessary to submit to the customers, and sometimes i have to coordinate with other departments to ensure the production. i thought engineer is purely to design something, but now i consider myself to be a project manager other than a designer. It really made me crazy and i am thinking of making a change.

When I started the Foundation Course I knew almost nothing from what I know now. Researches, ideas development, crits , everything was fresh. I have learnt and tried a lot of new techniques, wrote my first essay about art, started to mix different media to create a new piece, I understand materials and methods in a new level. One of my favourite topics is psychology. I think the most interesting things are hidden deep in our minds. I am fascinated by ideas of surrealist’s, Freud’s studies, fantasy and science-fiction books. The last thing I explored was a book of Jorge Luis Borges, which inspired me to make a research about fantastic stories. The same mood I have found in works of Francesca Woodman, her photography is something mysterious and magical for me. Her works reminded me of a futuristic band “Autechre”. The mood was also created with Jim Henson’s “Labyrinth”, famous “Matrix” made by Wachowski brothers and Tim Berton’s “Sleepy Hollow”. “So, the Labyrinth is a piece of cake, is it? Well, let's see how you deal with this little slice... “ In Part 1 one of my projects was about the edge between reality and the world of dreams, the wall which is destroyed by schizophrenia. I feel that I haven’t finished working on this topic, I want to explore it more. I see the connection between my old project and the idea I have now, I think I can use the research I made before. Moreover ,I won’t repeat mistakes I had in the first project. The topic of my FMP is “Labyrinth of mind”.I want to create a series of accessories for a book: a cover, bookmarks, map, postcards. The book is J.L.Borges’s  “Labyrinth”, which inspired me. This time I want to try printing on fabric and cut-up technique. I also thought of making a small 3D model of labyrinth, which can be completed only with using light, for example make hidden doors, place mirrors etc., which can be founded only in the shadow of labyrinth. I am also interested in using Fluxkits idea, I think I can place all the work in a special box. I am going to look through Borges’s works more carefully and make a research about him as a person. There are a lot of films on the “mysterious labyrinth” topic as well that are worth to watch. I also want to visit History museum and V&A costume section to get even more inspired by costumes of last 3 centuries. I am going to write down in my logbook each step I take ,so I can come back to the original idea and not get lost. I also started to collect questions for questionnaire , but more important questions will appear in process. Of course feedback is much appreciated ,it helps not to get stuck and shows all parts need to develop more.

Three days before I found a music video of my favorite groupe through internet (You tube).Four marionets play Coldplay's song. This music video is best one 2009 at the present. Because the situation of little town's festival is like a old tv series and expressions of people in this video are hyper good. I was laughed by children's blank look, and also the priest is best actor.The remakable stage effects and stage staff (marionets) are valuable for watching.I recommend the ending of this video, it gives you unforgettable impression. The girl wearing glasses with braid hair will be get awards.It goes without saying that this song is fabulous.I loved their music videos, especially "Yellow" 2000. Time pass rapidly,  I remenbered what I was in that year.And now I'm getting older, but I'd love to see Chris Martin ten years after.

Hi !Someone on this site was wondering why did people want to learn japanease.I thought that answer in english will make me practice and improve my english. Well, I'm a fan of learning foreign languages. I've tried all the languages proposed in highschool. First, I began with english. Then, I began italian but I couldn't have continued because it wasn't anymore in my highschool. After, I did german and spanish. I try to practice one a week. About japanease, I never had the idea to learn this language. I don't know Asia, it's a very unknow universe for me. I've never heard about their culture at school, it wasn't a language we could learn so I never wonder.Now, I'm a primary school teacher and in France we have got a list with the best literary books that we can study with the pupils. In this list there is the book called : "Cent onze haïkus" of Bashô. When I decided to work about poetry with my pupils, I chose to present this book. They had, at the end of the project, to produce one haïku, and, in visual arts I looked for their firstname in japanease. They did calligraphy to decorate their poem. Then I did a book with all their productions. Once, I fell on a site to learn japanease. It was a real undid for me to be able to understand the japanease signs. I'm very happy to have discovered this new language. I hope I will have japanease friends thanks to this site.

My dear friend from SingaporeAs expected, I write you to give you some news.I hope your working days weren't so hard and you are okay.Saturday morning, I will go two week to Bretagne (North West of France) with my family because we are in holidays until beginning of September.In France, it's the summer holidays (July and August) so I take advantage of them before working. I have a few questions to you : where do you live exactly in Singapore ? Do you have any photos of the city to send to me ? I spoke about you to my father during the dinner and he was impressed that I met you. I would like so much to visit Singapore and other Asian's countries with you (it's my greatest dream) but like you say, I still wait to be older and to have some money.If you travel in France, please come to visit us (we live in Nancy (North-eastern of France) : it is a little city of 110 000 inhabitants.We could visit Stanislas Plaza, a very beautiful place in Nancy. I will be happy to see you and to show you the French culture. I hope you will learn me Asian culture when I will go to Singapore in a few years (if I am lucky). Have a good day (or a good night) and  I hope to talk to you again soon when I will go back home (August 30th).Take care of yourself.See you soon

There is discussion. I'd like to learn Hebrew, but can't to install Hebrew letters on my computer because it would make problems for the other user on the comp. If I shell write Hebrew by Latin characters its would be...Write, please, the opinion of my dear reviewer, whom I am very grateful and whose English is much better then mine:The main reason why not is that it's harder for us, the native speakers, to read our language transliterated into latin characters. Instead of reading it fluently, we have to sound each word out in our mind to understand what you write. Furthermore, transliteration differences abound. And it's also not natural for us to write corrections in transliteration.Of course I can't speak for the rest of the native speakers here. There may be some native speakers who feel differently.

I work in a new company, suppling ceramic tile, mosaic and other building materials. The company is new enough that no product for sell, and no people would talk with you the truth word. Once, I want to know which products we have in stock, my colleague told me you knew too much. I am s salers, why a salers could not know how many products in stock of company. I am puzzied. But this is not the reason I want to quit my job.Last month, we have a new manager of our department, our department just have two members me and LL, new manager arrangered the work to us, the same work about sending promotion letter to his client. But later I didn't know why he treated us with unfair. One client had come to our showroom before, the manager and I entertained the client, but in the end, my colleague handled the following work. Except that the manager ask my colleague to do almost the whole thing, and we didn't even speak more that 5 sentences in a day. I could not intolerable that they talked the work between me and ignore me, as I sit between them. I think a manager will care about the team work, but not create the trouble between the colleagues. I don't think he is a good manager, he came to company just without one month, and I am sure I don't make anything wrong, I am just a freshman in this career, a manager can't tolerate a freshman, if he a good handler? I don't want to face with the people any more.

Whenever it rains, strangely,I often sleep badly.As if possessed by some devil another, I just went out.It was very cold outside. I took a bus to library.When it rains, I always go to the library to read books.I like to read books on rainy day, hearing the sound of raining.On entering library, a librarian took me joyfuly. I picked up a book depicting N.Y life. It describes "NEWYOCKER".In N.Y, there are many people from various country. They come N.Y,dreaming their success. One of them says in that book. "I love N.Y,because I can live freely without any trouble about my dream."However an another one says that life is hard anywhere.Life is always hard. I wanna go to the U.S.A. I hate routine life.I wanna live in wide world and meet many people.If I go to the U.S.A, mabye I can live new life.I want to live, engoying my own life. It was..six o'clock.I went out and stopped by cafe to buy coffee and some cookie.Then I came home about eight o'clock. Drinking coffee, I listened to jazz music lying on sofa.Then I fell a sleep, I think.I wish it will rain tomorrow again...

Greetings from Russia!My name is Lena and I’m from Moscow. Now I would like to write some sentences about jigsaw puzzles;)The fact is I have a hobby. My hobby is gathering jigsaw puzzles. I prefer those which consist of one thousand pieces or more. Also I choose only the pictures where some fantasy topics or beautiful nature and city views are depicted. Recently I have finished doing another one. So a few days ago I went to the hobby shop to buy a new one. It is situated in a mall in the suburbs of Moscow. There were a lot of people there as it was a day off. Also there was a wide choice of pictures there. That’s why my choice wasn’t very easy. I had been roaming for about 2 hours before I bought the picture I liked best of all. This jigsaw puzzle depicts one of beautiful views of London, which I was lucky to visit some weeks ago. Having bought it I dropped in at some other shops located in the mall. Before leaving it I looked in at the supermarket to buy some groceries.

I started to play guitar, on the beginning of last February. I bought an elegant black guitar of the, certainly not very well knowed mark : Blacksun. The begining was quite hard, as soon as i put my fingers on the board, i feel a sort of pain on them. I forced the pain, and after two weeks, the pain, vanished and my training could really start. The first song that i played, was the Godfather's tune, played on fingerstyle. I was very proud, and this first learnt song, gave me the desire to play more. I learned, some classical songs of the 80's, and since, i don't stopped :)On 8 months, we can say that i learned some guitar skill, now, i have to improve my level by playing others, a little bit more difficult, melodies. I'm now with game's songs with the interprets like Nobuo Uematsu, Masashi Hamazu who have done the songs of the well knowed saga : Final Fantasy.I'm doing my little work, and i'll do my best to master my level.SAD PS : My guitare was roughly broken last week, i'm still waiting the charpenter to fix it, but it seems that he'll take all his time.

Hi everybody, I'm going to speak about dreams.By "Dreams", i don't want to say, big dreams, for example the dreams which we made when we were young, become astronaut is a current dream for childrens for example. Well, no, i prefer to call it "Objectives or goals", I think than nobody can have a good and happy life without objectives, personnally, the thing who make me very happy, it's when I've a hard goal to achieve and with work, determination and courage, I arrive to do my objective. I think, a man who hasn't got goals in the life will have a sad and ordinary life, but I don't want to do generalities.  So, for me we cannot be perfect, so there are always goals in the life, there is always something to improve. It's an important part of happiness, for example, if we take the case of an obese man, it's really a disability in life. So, this man must have the goal to do a diet and sport but he must also conjugate this objective with others goals as "succeed at work" or "make a happy family". The combination of this objectives while he achieve his main goal (Slim) make him very happy.Personnaly, I have actually some goals, like achieve my studies, do sport to make me a beautiful body.. All this goals are conjugate around my main objective, more later I would like to go to others countries. Goodbye :)

Hey, guys! A topic which I find fascinating is politeness and rudeness in English. I've noticed that being polite in English-speaking cultures is extremely important, whereas it's not so in Argentina. For instance, I've been told that saying "What?" when you haven't understood what somebody has just said is not good manners. Instead, you should say: "I'm sorry, could you repeat that?", "Sorry, didn't quite catch that". Do you agree with this? Could you give me any more examples of politeness and rudeness in English? Thanks =)

The key to success include following neccesary priciples: honesty, diligence,devotion,and perseverance .    The first key to success is honesty,it is the best policy. There are many attemptations in society that if we are a little careless we may go astray. however ,if we take an honest attitude towards our study and work ,we shall not fail in it .    The second  key to success is diligence ,which means not wasting time .  the diligence make fool wise and pool rich .If we not idle our time away now ,we are sure to be successful in future.    The third key to success is devotion , which means consetration on somethings and make effort on somethings . It is a great force.whatever job we are doing we must love it and do it  whole_heartedly . only we do like this can we do it well . And we will find nothing is too difficult to accomplish.

Nobody could have failed to notice the fact that drunken driving has been a grave problem with which we are confronted. Generally speaking, there are several reasons accounting for /behind this phenomenon. Firstly, recent decades have witnessed the rapid development of people’s living standards. As a result, cars gained ever-increasing popularity and have found their way into our everyday life. Secondly, people participate in more activities or banquets than ever before, where they will drink liquor/strong wine. Then, they may get drunk but continue to drive.　　Drunken driving is bound to generate severe consequence if we keep turning a blind eye to it. Firs and foremost, this behavior will directly threaten the safety of drivers, passengers and pedestrians/goers, resulting in traffic accidents, injuries and even deaths. Besides, treating the injured and repairing broken cars mean a grievous waste of money, time and resources. Last but not least, this irresponsible driving will make the road a nightmare, and thus, it will causes serious losses of faith in governments and the society.　　In view of the seriousness of this problem, effective measures must be taken before things get worse. First, it is essential that the supervisory role of laws and regulations should be strengthened to punish those performing drunken driving. Secondly, the public, especially drivers, should enhance their awareness of public safety. With stringent laws and alert public, it will only a matter of time for drunken driving to become things of past.

Dear Scholarship Committee, I am writing to you to express my desire to participate in the Scholarship Programme for English Teachers 2010-2011, applying for Teachers Development Course (TDC) at The Anglo.Two years ago, I was granted a scholarship to study the Teacher Training Course and thanks to this training I have had better tools to improve my teaching experience. This training was reflected on my performance -which has been rewarded- and nowadays, I have more responsibilities in the university where I work.  This situation compels me to be updated and better qualified to select, adapt and design language syllabi and material.The TDC syllabi states that after completing the training, the participant will have acquired skills on evaluation material and syllabus design. For those reasons, I am really interested in taking it. Not only can I develop the skills needed at my current job but also I can enhance my comprehension of the teaching-learning precepts in more advanced students -the Achilles’ heel in the majority of language schools. Using both, skills and knowledge, I am sure I will be able to make proposals to help my students to compete with the international standards.However, in this moment, as I am still studying I can't work full time and I do not have a great income to afford the Course. The TDC represents for me an excellent opportunity to continue improving and I wouldn’t like that my financial restraint problem stops me. Due to this situation, I am totally reliant on the generosity of the foundation to be granted the scholarship for the TDC. I am looking forward to receiving the opportunity to study at The Anglo and to make a great contribution to my students. Thank you for considering my application.Yours faithfully, Jessica Viviana Toledo Aranda

Hello everyone!This is my very first post here, so I got nooooo clue what to write about.Well...First of all, my name is Alisa and nice to meet you all! Even though I live in Canada, English is not my first language (neither is French). I moved here from Russia in 2007. And since then I have been living in Montreal, Quebec. The very first reason for me to come was a chance to study abroad. I study social sciences but I plan to change a field later on. I will be graduating from Lasalle College in May 2010 and I can't wait to become a truly free person :)I enjoy my life in Montreal and I find it a great place to live and study.I think this site is a very good opportunity for many people. I would love to collaborate with some of you!Good luck everyone!

I am living in Berkeley, California. This town and Sanfrancsico have a lot of homeless people, although I do not know the exact number.I realized one thing about the homeless issue. I have not seen Asian aand Latino homeless people in California, even though there are a lot of Asian and Latino in this state. Of course, I have seen Japanese homeless in Japan. But there is few Japanese homeless in the U.S. Are Asian and Latino richer than other Americans? No. One hypothesis is that minorities tend not to become homeless.  Minorities are connected strongly within their ethnic group. They are minorities, but they are not alone, they help each other.   to be continued...

Today, I watched a video clip on internet. A little girl, about 6 years old, stood in a big ice hockey rink with plenty of audience. There was not much to tell from the scene, I guess this probably took place in the U.S. The girl was holding a microphone and singing American national anthem, her voice was innocent and clear like a soft breeze in the summer night. Unfortunately, the microphone failed, I can see her lips moving but without any sound. I really felt anxious about her. I did not know what would happen, would this little accident hurt her feeling with the sense of defeat? The pause was about 5 seconds, then some of the audience began to sing with her, the sound became louder and louder. Still I can see her lips were moving without hearing her voice, but what I can hear probably is love and respect.At that moment, I was touched.

Thi is going to be the first time that I write in lang-8. And I want so tell about my life in Japan.What is the reason that I am here, in Japan?This is my history.In 2009 I was living in Toronto studying english. And I was doing something else, my best hobby. Almost every day I used to go dancing salsa.And, one night I saw somebody and she was dancing very nice. I wanted to dance with her. So, I decided and I asked her "do you wanna dance". Usually couples only dance one song but with her (her name is Miwa), we danced almost seven o maybe more. That was very special.And? Well, Miwa is from Japan and she went to Toronto for one week for vacation, and specially for dancing salsa. Tha was my best week in Toronto, we spent fantastic, terrific time together, altought the weather was very cold. That happened at the first week of dicember of 2009.When she went back to Japan and me to Mexico, we kept contact by messenger. Almost every day we were chantting. We didn`t know what is gonna happend between us. One day she said " I want to go to Mexico". And she really did it. We spent another two wonderfulls weeks together. We were traveling in a car around Mexico. We visited Guanajuato, Paztcuaro, Morelia, Uruapan and others cityies. I need to go. I will finish this in the afternoon.

My Advanced English teacher demand me make a comparison between the movie Tangshan Earthquake and the text Hurricane Camille.    I hope my dear friends could help me check the grammar. Sincere thanks.The similarity: Firstly ,the two stories are concerned with disasters.  Secondly,the characters are members of a common family.Third, the stories are adaption from real accidents.The differences: Tangshan Earthquake is arounds a woman and her 2 children, it describes what happened on their family before the earthquake,during the earthquake and after the shock. Hurricane Camille is around a family and their friends how to fight against the hurricane, and the utmost courage and determination during the fighting.Secondly,   Tangshan Earthquake put emphasis on the lives of some particular people, and take audience into the movie's world through the characters' fieldof views.But the Hurricane Camille put emphasis on the main characters' mutual encouragement and their love to children.Thirdly, the theme of the Tangshan Earthquake is the relationship between familiy members and the comprehension between the two generations. The theme of the Hurricane Camille is signify the humanistic greatness and their faith in life.

Hi, I am brook from korea.English always has been a daunting challenge for me since I was little. Since I was born and raised in korea where fluent english skill is necessary for success and everyone seems to be crazy about learning english, I was forced to study english hard like other korean students.Thanks to those years spent learning English, now my english is okay, I guess. I am quite good at reading and listening so i enjoy reading books written in english, often listening news in english. But the problem is speaking and writing. The 'English'I learn from school and other private institutions didn't make me speak or write in english well. I often find myself having difficulty in expressing my own thoughts and feeling in english. How frustrating it is...I tried to write something(like book reviews)in english on some websites, but I was so ashamed of my english that I just coulnd't. And then, I find this site!It's for learners, so there's no reason i should be ashamed of my poor english!And plus, maybe some kind people will correct wrong sentences or grammatical error. how cool!Anyway i am so glad to find this site and hope my english can be improved.

Hey everybody!Well, my name's Lisa, I'm 17 years old and I live in France, most precisely in the north, where the weather is awful everyday and where the rain became our friend!I'm someone who really enjoys languages. Currently I'm learning english and spanish... I used to learn Italian but I stopped because I was always mistaking between Italian and Spanish... I'd like to learn German but for the moment, I prefer to acquire good levels in both languages before learning German. If I could, I would learn each language but my free time doesn't help me with doing that... About my everyday life, I'm a student and so I go to school every day! I admit that sometimes I'd prefer staying home, laying in my bed! Maybe that's because I like to think about everything and those moments help me to escape life's reality which hurts sometimes... I don't know :)About my hobbies, well I like doing sport, listening to music (of course, what would we be without it ??), mhh watching great films, especially at the cinema... I also enjoy going out with my friends. They're very nice and I have wonderful time with them! And finaly, I love to be with my family!In my life as a teenager, I'm accustomed to little problems... School, boys, friendships... Well, there are some things I can't handle! I try to be as mature as I can, because I'm someone who thinks a lot about the future.. Well I don't want to destroy my life ! So even if it is quite hard sometimes, I keep it to myself, I try to find out what my problems are and then everything goes on much better :)Later, I would like to work as a conceptrice-writer, in publicity. I don't know the name of the job I want to do, but in a nutshell, a person who does that job finds ideas to create the commercial! He finds the topic and the slogan.So, to end me introduction, I really hope meeting nice people here. Thank you for your help, and don't hesitate if you have any problems with your french :)

This week was filled with a lot of things.First, last Wednesday I did an exam at the university. But the context was the one of a movie. All that day was raining. I went to the workplace (office) with the company of a soft water falling from a silver cloud. At lunch, a thin rain induced me to buy a delicious dish (empanadas). When I was going to the university, it was raining really hard, and I got a headache. I solve the exam really fast, and then I went home, to slept.The last Thursday I had to inscribe me to the courses of this semester. I choose some subjects, that will allow me to keep working while studding. my career, engineering, really takes time to be completed, and it is really easy to lost years if you do not pass one subject in time. Some times, because of being at work, you could not assit and looses exams, just a little problem, with a big impact on your life.I started this week to study, I feel condifent I will have a nice semester.A good news is that a coworker lend me a book about kanji... all written in japanese. It will take time to digest it, but it will be so sweet to read it that I am really happy about that.Nowadays my current topic at Japanese is to end learning katakana, that is why I have to wait until I could learn more vocabulary, verbs in particular.

Hello, I'm Baptiste, I'm 15 (16 on the 29th of May) and I live in Perpignan, a city of the South of France, near of Spain.

Yesterday, I went to Shenzhen for an interview,seeking a new job. I was quite nervous during the part of self-introduction which is my first time to introduce myself in English. I felt quite regret that I didn't perform well, so I'm not sure whether the owner will employ me or not. The job sounds good job for an internship, except that I have to leave this place(my campus) to a strange city where I don't like much. Shenzhen is too noisy for me. It seems that I've graduated before June next year. I don't want to leave those people I have got to known so much. One day I'm sure that I will miss all of you guys here. But I still hope that I could get the job.

The young man kept quiet. I would have listened to him until the end of time.-Does it fit you, pretty young girl? Right now, pass me back my glaces; Europa must be awaken. Let's work.He used to pronounce the meanest french word with a meticulous greediness. As a consequence, his story had lasted hours. The afternoon had greatly started.I followed him in the ground floor where he used to live, a one-piece flat which overlooked a courtyard full of oil cans.-What's your job?-Am I wrong or you pronounce in a peculiar way?-I have a little problem with accents, I'll explain you. But, all the same, I repeat: How do you earn a living?-I'am...I'am a sort of policeman.He switched on his computer and cried out:-They've been arriving!!-Who the hell?-The car fines of the week-end: traffic lights gone through, prohibited parkings, bus lanes followed...-I've not seen many traffic lights into town.-It's normal; I'am in charge of the fines from Brest, a city from where you live, in a region called Bretagne I guess.-But why you and why India?-I work three times faster than a Franchman and I cost seven times less.

You know what, the oral English is the biggest obstacle for me to charge myself.I know how to write,how to read,how to listen,but I don't have any good idea of how to speak it fluently and naturally.I try my best to describe something beyond my reach in English,but there's always failure to show my mind from the bottom of my heart.Absolutely,I'm dummy.I can't share my opinion correctly with each other.Every time I try to ignore my embarrassment to let shyness go,as a result of the shit performance I'm really sick of giving the chance to change again.Oh,my godness,what Can I do with my poor communication in English?I'm insane from A  to Z. It's the hazzard process to make a progress for the seasoned learner. Actually,I want to have an amazing shift of the fault on this aspect.I major in the International Trade,so the ability to speak English is more important than the written one.I just wanan put what I learnt into practice and make them become parts of my future career or life.I hope one day I can have a good commmand of English as well as my mother tongue.God bless me.-ZANE

During people's life, it is no doubt that they meet various problems. People have to spend lots of time to solve these problems. People's solutions may vary as different people may have different ideas. However, in my opinion, understanding the past is a good way to solve the problems present and future, as it can improve the sufficiency of solving problems， give us lots of valuable solutions and even avoid these problems. To begin with, understanding the past can increase the speed of solving problems. As we all know, there are some principles in our society, just as the regulation of evolvement that exists in nature. Events may occur, develop and disappear according to some principles and have its own internal regulations. As a result, we can predict what will be happened about the problem in the future according to understanding the past. And with the past experience, we can predict immediately that some solutions will not work positively, so we do not need to waste time to try these solutions. We only need to take actions to use some valuable solutions. In this way, problems can be solved with higher sufficiency. Moreover, understanding the past can offer people many valuable solutions. And people can use these to solve problems present and future. As the development of the society has its own regulation and people can catch it through understanding the past. So solutions about some similar problems are still useful in modern society. When people can not come up with good solutions for a long time and they do not actually know what to do next, they'd better to check the history and find some similar problems that existed in the past. Think about solutions of these problems, then people may have a new thinking about the problem. They may also have a better solution considering the solutions in the past. Thus understanding the past can give people more good solutions to the problem present and future. In addition, understanding the past can even teach people how to avoid problems present and in the future. As I have written, the society develops with its principle and some events and things may repeat at interval. Therefore, if people can understand the causes, the beginning of the problem, they can take actions immediately to avoid the problem when there are some clues that demonstrate that some problems may happen next. Fortunately, people can save lots of time and energy comparing to solving problems after they have happened. There is a traditional Chinese saying that understanding the past can know the present and future better. To solve the problems present and future is it necessary to understand the past.

Between 2000 and 2007, the number of death, especially among children, droped from 750.000 to 190.000 a year all over the world, according to the calculation of WHO.Those figures were published in the WHO weekly epidemiological record ( 5th December ) and the weekly CDC Morbidity and mortality weekly report. The encouraging result is due to the vigorous action of the founder parters of the Initiative against measles : American red cross, Center for Disease Control and Prevention of United States ( CDC ), the UN fondation, UNICEF and WHO.In the WHO's releas, the president of american red cross board, Bonnie McElween-Hunter, highlighted that " the credit of this success is deserved to the thousand of heath workers volonteers of the Red Cross and Red Crescent organization who had taken the time to be informed, to raise awarness and motivate the mothers and the family circles to the critical importance of the children vaccination.

I spent a lot of time online such as watching many videos on YouTube, reading Wikipedia and blogs. Fortunately, it was Sunday, so doing that all day didn’t make any trouble for anyone.What a waste of time! I really hate that behavior, but I couldn’t stop that. At first, I felt they were interesting, so seeing it seemed to be a bit valuable to me. A few hours after seeing it, I became aware that they were useless information.I began to suspect that I am a bit addicted to the Internet. I usually have a lot of plan to do, so I don’t have time to be online long time.

Summer, 1690s, London , England  ‘Amy…’ She could hardly recognize her own voice, hoarse and weak-willed. It seemed to sound through a shroud of mist, penetrating a prism of pain and distorting.         It was someone’s warm palm that covered her own right hand. She gave a start and opened her eyes. It was a beautiful day and an unknown window of a room she was in. The sunshine was so bright that she couldn’t even distinguish the features of the girl who was sitting by her and holding her hand.       ‘So… Does it mean that I’m dead?’ ‘Oh, no. Not yet. But you are far away from the sea.’       These words made her soul shrink in pain, but the reason was unknown. The lady set in a cosy armchair and now it was possible to see her face good enough to find out that she’s young and beautiful. Ginger hair and hazel eyes, smiling rosy lips…She had seen her face before. She was dressed like a man: she wore a shirt with wide sleeves, black trousers, a vest and boots. ‘Amy Brown…This is your name, isn’t it?’ she asked. ‘It is. But do you remember your own?’ Ms Brown smiled lightly. She felt terrified. No…no…she didn’t know that! What has happened to her? What on earth could make her forget? ‘I don’t…Do you know it?’       ‘We have been together, side by side for such a long time that I couldn’t forget it even if I would like to, Anna Welling.’ She said it ironically though her voice sounded kindly. ‘Where am I and why am I here?’Now she could control herself and her voice good enough to seem confident. ‘The time to discuss that hasn’t come yet. You should put your life in order. Though…there has never been order in your life.’ Amy smoothed her hair. ‘Amy Brown, please! You know me better than I do. Tell me what you know!’ said Anna persistently.    But the girl only shook her had, stood up and walked towards the window disappearing in the sunlight. ‘Wait! I beg you…’   ‘Amy!’Anna sprang to her feet and ran towards the door. Her heart was pounding fastly, as she opened it.‘Calm down, my dear…’ said a quiet man’s voice from behind. Anna turned in surprise and noticed an old man sitting in the armchair, where Amy set some minutes ago.       ‘I can’t understand!’ she touched her temple. ‘But where is Amy?’ ‘It depends on who is she, my darling.’ He came nearer and looked in her face. ‘So who is she?’       ‘I don’t know.’ She felt silly.       ‘However, you do remember her name. And yours? Do you remember it too?’ ‘My name is Anna. Anna Welling.’       ‘Oh, good. Very good,’ he smiled. ‘And I am Doctor Nicholas Beliford.’Mister Beliford, could you tell me, where am I? ‘Of course, my darling. You are in Mrs. Havilland’s mansion not far from London .” ‘ London ?’ she repeated in surprise. ‘You shouldn’t think so much. You’d better rest. And I’ll go to Mrs Havilland to tell her that you feel better. That’s good news for her.’ He opened the door and left Anna alone to face with her growing panic.     The ceiling was white and decorated with stucco mouldings. The wainscots were made of light wood so that the room was unusually lit by the sun. The only window was high and its upper part was a circle of glass of golden colour. Elegantly carved furniture and everything around her looked luxurious but Anna knew that she wasn’t used to such lifestyle.      She touched her chest and came across a silver chain with a medallion on it ‘A familiar thing,’ she thought, looking at the red gem in the middle. A light press-and it opened. “Anna Marie Elizabeth Welling”- were the words engraved inside. It was her name. She could remember nothing except two names: Anna Welling and Amy Brown, her own and...whose? The medallion clicked under her fingers hiding its secret. Anna approached to a large mirror and began examining herself. She had wavy brown hair and green eyes with golden sparkles in them. There was a grin on her lips, and it looked like it was her usual face. Though she had strong arms and was really well built, the white shirt she was dressed in couldn’t hide the fact that such kind of constitution could fit a lad better than a maid.      In the afternoon Anna talked to the hostess, Amanda Havilland, who was a pleasant woman with golden hair and always smiling face. She told Anna a strange story that was the only explanation of her being here. She had been having a voyage with her partner but a sudden storm had broken their plans. A strange storm, a deserted island and a girl near the water looking like she was dead. Those were the facts. And they were not consoling. So the only thing Anna could do now was staying with lady Amanda, who was very kind to her.    Some days later Mrs. Havilland was having guests. Anna was introduced as one of her numerous nieces. She was well-mannered and was good at playing the harp and accompanying Mrs. Havilland’s singing. A young man, Captain Richard Blackenstar, couldn’t look away. Anna felt his gaze and wondered if he could know her before. In the evening she took her chance to slip out and went to the garden. She expected the young man to come. And he was there. ‘The evening is cool,’ she said.       ‘Cool but amazing. But there is no need walking here, if you feel cold. We can join the others.’‘Not now. I would like to ask you, sir…Have we ever met before?’ ‘I am sure, we have not. If I had met you before, I would never have forgotten.’                After that day Mr. Blackenstar visited Mrs. Havilland two or three times. Lady Amanda looked happy and was really in high spirits. It was a pretty thing for her: love. As for Anna, she couldn’t understand how she felt. She learned that love and even care were feelings just incomprehensive. She found out that she was rather strong-willed and even imperative though she tried not to show these qualities to those who surrounded her now. She knew she used to command. But in what way? The one thing she knew exactly was that the day when she will recollect all her previous life is going to turn everything upside down.                                                                            ***       One gloomy day Anna was walking along a narrow street in London . She had to pay for Lady Amanda’s dress. She did it a half an hour ago and now enjoyed her freedom. It was exciting to feel free.The by-street she crossed was dark and muddy. The only one thing that attracted her attention was a sign of a little inn made of copper. The door of the inn creaked and a man walked out. He looked drunk and Anna tried to pass him as quick as she could but he looked right into her face surprisingly. ‘So…Is that you, Anna?’ he asked.       ‘W..what?’ she couldn’t believe he knew her. ‘Why did you come back again? Are you not afraid of being imprisoned, Captain Welling? I’ve never seen you dressed like that. This pretty gown suits you. ’ he laughed. ‘Do you know me, sir?’ she asked cautiously. ‘What did you say? Sir?’ he laughed again. ‘Don’t pretend you see me for the first time. If you are here on the business of your own, just say so.’ Then he turned and walked away.         Anna stood stock-still. She could not say a word. But now she recalled the night of her escape, the burning ships of her father’s, her revenge and her new life full of freedom. A life of a pirate. ‘Stop, Dick!’ she said firmly and the man turned to her. ‘I changed my mind.’ She could hardly recognize her confident voice. ‘Are there any boats you can offer? Let’s get out here. I’ve found out an interesting thing. I’m sure Chris and Amy will come here soon. Oh, I missed her…so much!’       ‘Eh? Whom? D’you mean miss Brown?’ asked Dick with a smile on his face.       ‘No, fool! I mean my boat, of course…My beloved Midnight Star.’   In the evening Anna came back and tried to behave as usual. Mrs. Havilland handed her a letter from Richard Blackenstar in which he wrote that he had to leave England for a while. ‘Don’t be so sad, my dear,’ said the woman to her. ‘It’s just because of his service.’ Anna didn’t regret, of course.                                                                                         ‘Is the reason piracy?’ she asked with a faint smile. ‘Yes, it causes too many problems. What disgrace!’ Lady Amanda threw up her hands. Anna looked at the window. Now she had an idea of what to do. Late at night she went to her bedroom, changed her clothes and now looked like a boy. She sat at the table and wrote a letter:  Dear Mrs Havilland, I cannot express how grateful I am to you for your saving me, taking care of me and for those wonderful days we spent together. But now it is time for me to go. My trip to London helped me to make decision. I met people, who know me, and they are ready to help me return my past. It’s a pity I can’t thank you for all you did for me and it is much worse that I must tell you the truth. My real name is Anna Marie Elizabeth Welling, and I wish I could forget it for ever to live in peace. But I can’t do anything with it. Anyway, my fate will find me. That is why I must go now. It is the way to my real life. The only way. You can act like you consider better. I’ll always be thankful for your kindness.   Please, remember me to Richard and tell him that we are sure to meet sooner or later.                                                                                                 Sincerely yours,                                                                                                                  Anna.            She took a red rose from the vase on the table and put it on the sheet of paper. It was a broad grin on her face when she jumped out the window and walked through the garden. Of course, it will be funny to tell Amy about that wonderful dinner and the guests delighted with her playing the harp. May be, it was the last time she did it. She hoped so. Dick is waiting for her on the cross-roads. She was in danger again. Captain Blackenstar didn’t notice the notorious female pirate Anna Welling under his very nose. She had a good chance to start from the beginning and change her life. But there was no reason for that. This country deprived her of everything she loved. She had to settle a score and she was not going to give up.

    As we all konw, there exist a lot of differences between two kinds of languages, for example, English and Chinese. I am very proud of being a chinese and I am very fond of my native language. However,  the habits of speaking chinese set numerous difficulties when I am learning English.     In fact, I am very good at reciting words. It seems that keeping English words in mind for a long period of time is very hard for chinese students, but it is very easy for me no matter how many words there are.    I am very worried about my listening and writing skills. I can only get 50% of total scores when we have an English exam. My English teacher has ever told me:"Reciting English words only is useless unless you know how to use those words." I tried many ways but I ended with failure every time. I don't know how to improve my English listening and writing skills.  I sincerely hope that any one here can give me a hand.

Imagine if any countries had police, how would be our lives? In my opinion the police represent a hard role giving us their help and also making our lives less dangerous.First of all, the role of police in my country is not the best service compared with the role of police in New York. In Colombia when some people have trouble hesitate to call the police because this takes almost an hour to arrive and therefore this does not help much. Furthermore is not common to see the police on the street or near home that is why in my country people feel insecure about asking the police for help and is also the last option that people think for helping. On the other hand the role of police in New York is much better because you can see their work in different places. Probably this is because New York has many rules and laws that the police should enforce; perhaps that is why some people in the U.S hesitate to call the police for help because depending on the severity of the problem also depends on how long the process will take in case you have to go to court. In New York whatever where you go you can find the police, then you can feel more confident and secure asking the police for help.Therefore, I think that the best way for solving the problems or some questions is calling the police.

Frank moved to Guangzhou after long time consideration from another city. Finally he settled down in his new apartment and we had a welcome dinner together last night in a Indonesian restaurant which was absolutely new for me. I have not tried Indonesian food before but similar ones such as Singaporean and Malaysian dishes when I traveled there back to 2007. Southeast Asia food is full of spicy, curry tasting in common. I like it since the influence I got from my previous company, a Singapore based firm in Shanghai. I had good memory both about my pre-boss and good trip in Singapore and Malaysia. I was treated with lots of fun, adventure, foods and for sure can not be forgotten, humid and hot weather. Ok, back to the Indonesian restaurant. It is a tradtional one decorating with local stuff, french window, cane chair with the gentle local background music. I can smell the Indonesian in air. The dishes were really good and mostly important the price is fair too. PS. I came back after long time disconnected with Lang-8. ^_^ Keep in touch, guys.

Dear Sirs,  We  would like to apologise for the repeated troubles of AAA manufactured by D co. at M co, and would like to report the result of the investigation by D co. along with our support proposal below. As stated in the report, regrettably the troubles that needed replacing its mother board have happened often since this model WS333 was released, however we judged that there is no concern for lot defect because there has not been such report so far from D co. quality assurance dept.after their investigation. Despite these inconvenient facts happened so far, its our policy to employ PC from D co. for AAA in our system because of their excellent global service network. For further details, attached please find the trouble report from D co. Japan.   For further troubles in future, we have the support organization by our subsidiary as follows and would like to request you to advise M co. that M co. contact Y co.  when something wrong happend in our system, We will support Y co. and take over them if Y co. does not work so well as customers expect.  As our proposal, we would like to suggest that M co.  go into the maintenance contract with the contact point below so as to prevent troubles in the whole system from happening.  Though the trouble rate may be higher for AAA product however, taking into account that a trouble happens overseas, we would like to recommend D co. because they have a global service network that supersedes any other manufacturers and they can solve troubles sooner. Even though we procure a AAA in Japan and transfer it overseas, D co.  can identify it by it’s unique tag no and we can take advantage of their guaranty system wherever the AAA is transferred in the world.Sincerely yours,

I often heard (and said also) that French people are not good at speaking foreign languages, specially English language. Because, of course, English is the main foreign language for all non native speakers.I suppose it's true but I'd like to point out several reasons which, for me, could explain that. I recently realized, while I was learning Chinese, that English and French were very close. A lot of words are indeed the same because of the history of both languages, common roots or other reasons I don't want to develop. So, the first reflex when trying to communicate is to simply translate from French to English using similar words. Sometimes, it can be very confusing because all phrases and sentences can't match that way. And when it comes to speaking, French people are also tempted to prononce the same way they would do in their native language. Which oftens gives someting completely lame.I can mention the fact too that, as opposed to Chinese speakers whose ears are used to recognize the different tones, we French people use a flat tone language and don't even figure out that tones are also important while speaking in English.I don't want to excuse our poor language skills but just understand why this is the case !

I've been learning English for a long time, but there are a lot of complicated expressions difficult for understanding. I mean phrases of "live" English, phrases we won't find in our textbooks.Not long ago I discovered for myself a very interesting group "MGMT". I want to ask native english-speakers about the meaning of one phrase from the song "Congratulations". I adduce a piece of text (it was found in the Internet :))But I've got someone to make reportsAnd tell me how my money's spentTo book my stays and draw my blindsSo I can't tell what's really thereAnd all I need's a great big congratulationsWell, what do they mean singing "to book my stays"? The verb "to book" means something like "register" in this case, right? But what about "stays" and the phrase in common? A riddle...

I am a French woman of 49 years old. I have been living in Marseille for about 10 years since 2000.I am now working In Paris which is not so far by train : only 3 hours. I live in Paris from Monday to Wedneday or Thrusday, and then I go back home.I have a good command in English reading, but a poor one in writing. I like speaking a lot, so even with a lot of mistakes I always try to speak in English with english speakers.I love learn new languages. Six years ago, I went to Italy. Without any knowledge at the beginning, after a fortnight, I could manage with italan people daily conversation, and understand many things. Italian is my preferred language because of Latin roots. It's for me a kind of very old French. And there a very interesting grammar with very funny tenses as for example subjunctivo. For me as a French speaker, it's quite an old-fashioned tense, but in Italian it has a daily use.Stop now with grammatical considerations ! Here I'd want to improve my english writing, to become fluent and be able to write a rich and correct english. I'd need it for job. Neverby, it's not the only reason. I like very much english too, and would be fluent.See you later

To prevent feeling guilty.I clarify this post is written after I had used 7 hours to study biology and mathematics.This is because I do not want anyone to use this reason which is "online" and claim that I never study .Now the time is 2.18am , I feel very tired and sleepy but I adhere to finish this post in order to release my stress and dissatisfaction.I have been in Pra-U more than one year .and I know STPM is just around the corner so I burned my time to study , escape every entertainment and set a timetable for myself in order to finish my syllabus revision .but TODAY , I received a very bad bad saying.I do not know this saying was a kind of motivation or just simply say out just want to make us to become more stress, or you want to compare our wisdom ?The teacher keeps saying we are not in revise progress ,no seriousness, asking question do not know how to answer , still very playful and so on I myself who really study seriously felt very depressed that what she had said to us When you're doing something wholeheartedly , suddenly someone come to scold you and blame you by saying some very ear-piercing words , I sure you will feel very discouraged .and she keeps comparing the lower six with us , saying the lower six students are more hardworking and serious than you guy ,theirs books are full with highlighting and note and bla bla bla ............. Why la ? The teachers do not understand what is the difference between the lower six and us, probably they are good but the teachers are not suppose to compare us with them , you are depressing your students and the students will feel inferior and remain the same or go some more worst That's why from earlier time , I had told myself that I never become the first in my life.See what happen now ? If you become the first , people will start to compare you with others and if you are not good enough ,people will criticize and try to pull you to the bottom , and what is your feeling ?and now the condition is the same , we are first batch of Pra-U students , many things has not been settled , we are so busy with co-curriculum ,we have PBSM, R&D and games , everything is new . So, as the first batch ,we tend to organize by ourselves , even the teachers also had no idea with what they suppose to do .We plan everything nicely , try to work out the impossible and so on .and of course we never neglect our study but our results were not as good as the last batch which called Form six students with minor curriculum recently.come to ours , we have more burden, and the teachers ....................The teacher never realize that we have a lot of thing to do until everything is over may be not all of us involved but please understand us that how distraction we are ?and NOW , the lower six enter Pra-U so nicely without worrying , everything has been planned and settled .They just have to continue and make it more systematic.see..... how good they are !!!!of course , things will tell our mind that we should eliminate the bad thing and left the good thing belong us . We are first batch , everything are tested by us at first , use a lot of money to buy shirt buy baju korperat ,payment , and unnecessary .We are just a rat dissection , after being dissected , and throw away ...... how sad we are ? but no one is going to understand , no one is going to take compassion on us . the teachers like non-stop scolding us and just want us to leave the school as fast as possible . They just think that everyone were just the same , they think that we never appreciate their effort on teaching, purposely make discipline problem and so on .besides, the teachers tend to use the lower six to compare with us ,they embarrass us in front of lower six students, and we become a gossip topic among them .what I dislike the most was the teachers are not enjoying on teaching us .She always complain how bad attitude we are and compare the students who thought by her before she came to this school.I just want to say , you can not expect every students can get the good result ,how about the student who really work hard but still can not achieve a good result? Sometimes, if you think everything is possible ,why we have to study some more , we can just wait for the next second to see what happen to us ,it is possible that I will become a millionaire ,who knows ?I felt very sad and want to cry out when I heard the words that came out from her mouth.I do understand her feeling , she just want her students appreciate her effort ,I can see from her eyes.she compare our wisdom to some one who just said to her a few good word .How could you say this? do you really understand him? are you saying that we do not have wisdom ? we are stupid ? we do not have any knowledge ?I have told myself , if I become one of a top student of STPM ,I will say this out to let them regret and prove that we are different ,and do not despise us . depressed .....

One of my friend recommended a site named lang-8. Users writes diary in foreign languages then native speakers will fix it for the writer. That's the power of community.The cost of doing tasks by people isn't evenly distributed. I mean tasks that are difficult for some people may be easy for other people. As trading goods improves overall productivity, I think these kinds of communities can also improve overall happiness. So this is what people say "collective intelligence", isn't it?Wikipedia is a good example. People's knowledge isn't evenly distributed. Most of the time, I get help by reading articles, but I still have opportunity to write/modify articles about material that I'm good at.Well.. Will there be any sites that will cover other areas?

Thank you for reading this! I am in preparation process to IELTS examination and looking for your assistance with English. This is the random topic I just received:Some people believe that modern games played by children do not develop a wide range of skills. Traditional games, however, develop different skills in children. To what extent do you agree? And now look at my essey:Games are undoubtfully important for health and phisical skills of children. But unfortunatelly today we can see that our favorite yard games are not so popular between kids. They prefer computers and videogames rather then fresh air activities. My choice is obvious - children should play real games! I am not athletic fanat, but at least they have to feel qurious and to be interested in school-yard games, they need to run, to jump and so on. Computer games are acceptable just in case of bad weather. Fresh air games develop phisical skills, make chuldren stronger, faster and improve their health. Sitting hour by hour at the same position and keep an eye on the screen harm young kids health. Therefore, I completely agree with idea that traditional games develop skills much better then modern games.

This is text i've written in order to test my formal english. I'd really thank if you help me by correcting the bad expressions, just be careful and try not to confuse me. This is neither the real text nor the complete one. I'm writing it in fragments and modifying it, of course.------------------------------------We're usually doing different things not to think about one single topic. Can you figure someone thinking about only one theme? For sure that person is probably going crazy. But we don't have to deal hard with this, because the current time have a great arsenal of items that get us out of the actual world. But, wait, because I haven't said that that necessary has to be an advantage. Is an advantage if we look at it from the point of the practicity.Everything is easier nowadays, we have access to a lot of info that people in the past didn't have. That's probably the real essence of the inventions of men since immemorable times. However, there's something that I cannot trust yet, and it's these studies that have come out about the rate of intelligence and it says that people from the present time have a higher intelligence rate. But, what about the great scientifics from the 15th 17th 18th, and so on? are we by chance smarter than then? hell no!As far as I'm concerned, I don't find practicity good tool, since it feeds our lazyness. The people from the past didn't enjoy the Internet and maybe nice and organized libraries as we have now, it was harder for them to find anything they needed. I cannot imagine Newton searching for the Aristotle or Da Vinci's life and works, pressing, maybe, ctrl+f so that he could find the key word on "Metaphysics". That's what makes me think they, the first scientifics, deserve more merit than any others, they had to make a REAL research, book by book, page by page, experiment after experiment.

It's all over the news. The former president of Ivory Coast refused to step down after he lost the presidential election recently.  Millions of people all over the world witnessed this absurd political drama /unfortunately tragedy for those people who lost their lives and injoured. What's the meaning of letting people vote? I wish they could solve this problem peacefully for the sake of their innocent civilians.

As a computer engineer English language it's something that you always have to carry in your luggage. Technical books are written in english first and this job is always pushing harder against the clock. You have to be up to date so if you wait for translation of a book then it could be too late.
