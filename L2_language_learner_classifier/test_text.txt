I just deleted all the stuff I had written, I´ve decided to write an actual personal journal. Now, I´m gonna do it in English because, after all English is my second language and the whole point of this web page is be ¨language helped¨ so, I´m sure there will be plenty of stuff for me to improve on, heck lord knows that would probably be the case even if I were to write this in spanish.Anyways,  So I´ll get started. I´m currently 25 years old, and at this point in my life, I have come to realize that most of the stuff I´ve done so far, has happened because I thought I was supposed to do it, and it´s not that I regreat anything, but now I understand why I felt confused and lost after graduating from the university. After getting my degree, I didn´t automaticaly get a job, in fact I spent several months doing almost nothing (well I´m kinda always working as a freelance illustrator but that´s really just a hobbie), and that kinda depressed me, I felt like such a loser, but I didn´t know what to do, I didn´t want to just get a job, what about my ¨dreams¨ what about the stuff that was supposed to happen, you know, we all go through this at some point, and people tell jokes about it all the time, but damn!, that still dont make it any easier to accept, does it?.Last year I found a job oportunity as a videogame designer, I did many tests and actually got the job, I felt so happy because I thought I would be doing something close to my dream (after all I HAD studied to be a designer) and to be honest, it felt good to have won the job over many other aplicants. Unfortunately as months went by, I lost hope on the company, most of their videogames were copy versions of other famous games, and after talking to many coworkers, I realized they would never let me make an original game, they even scolded me once for not copying other games. So since I wasn´t making that much money anyways, I just quit, I mean after all, I wasn´t even working for them directly, but through another company that specializes in hiring people. I would´ve ¨lived¨ in that studio for something I believed in, and I almost did some times, but then... well... I already wrote that.So yeah, right now, I´m fighting to do what I really feel like doing... I always wanted to learn japanese? never did cuz I was led to believe it was too damn hard and there was no point to it since I already spoke english anyways; fuck it I´m learning japanese, I never learned to play the guitar as a teenager; fuck it Im learning to play the guitar; I need to get a job? I´ll teach  english... I´m not good enough? I´m not really a teacher yet?, fuck it I´ll learn that too.I never really did a journal; thought it was pointless; who would care about this stuff; fuck it I´m writing it for myself.This generation... my generation, doesn´t really seem to know what they want, you grow up watching TV, playing videogames and daydreaming, but sooner or later you have to wake up. I try not to whine but, this is kinda what I see around me and sometimes still see in myself... I don´t think it ever goes away, I believe now that we ought to be always looking for our own paths to walk, to make our own lives the adventure we want to live, and just knowing that is exciting already.

Hi! Well, I've been a Lang-8 User since January of this year. I found this web site in the ending of the last year, and I thought it was a great idea to write some texts in the languages I'm studying in order to improve them. So I decided to register myself.In the part of the registration, where they ask you two languages that you're learning. First, I thought in English and French. But a year ago, I started learning Japanese and I thought it was a better idea to write as the languages I was learning French and Japanese. But I'm still learning English, and I think that I still comitting a lot of mistakes XD I'm sure of it. Recently, I discovered that not only I could write texts in French and Japanese, but also in English and any other language. And now I'm writting this text to check-out how my English is doing. What do you think? How bad my text is? Please comment in the bottom ↓↓↓.Another thing that I use to do in order to improve my language, especially my Listening and also my Speaking [while singing songs] is to search songs ♫ in the language I'm studying and its respective lyrics ♪. So I hear the song, while I'm reading and cheking the lyrics and the pronunciation. Also I try to listen to different accents. For example, I try to listen songs of different English accents: British, American, Irish, all are different. Also I use to watch movies in the languages I'm learning, especially in English. But that's more difficult to do in French and in Japanese, because here in my country, there aren't too much movies in French and even less in Japanese. But always I watch most of movies in English. Actually, I prefer in English that in Spanish XD. I know that the best thing you shoud do to improve a language is to speak in that language, but everyone I know, hate languages :'( and they don't wanna talk with me. Well, that all for now, I think I've written enough =D. I'll try to write another text in English. But at leat for now, Do you think there's something else I could do in order to improve my languages? See you later! And thanks for reading my journal! If there's something I could do to help you with your languages...I'll be glad to help you! Good-bye

on the very first day of 2010, there was heavy snow in Seoul(the capital city of Korea), to tell more specific, it was the worst snowfall since official measurement was documented(it was over 26 cm). Unfortunately, for a few few days from the day, I had to clear away the snow, on the first day, I cleared away tennis coat. It was a little terrible,and for the rest of the days, soccer field was my work place, can you guess ? I had to clear away all snow on the field. It was... It was..not terrible, but HORRIBLE. It was impossible to utilize any machinery to protect grass(although it is articifical....) Shovel was only available tool I could use .... I will never forget this winter, and 2010 ...I felt like being a slave in plantation farm.

I went to Chinese Hot pot restaurant last night.I had dinner with friends. They are Japanese,Chinese and Swiss.The Swiss guy told us that he is leaving Shanghai this Friday.he will take train to somewhere in China. Amazingly It will take for 22hours with no seat! It means he have to stand in the train whole 22hours....then, one of us advised him to try to negotiate with people who are sitting on the seat.It was a kind of joke. but i thought it worth trying.because here in China,you can negotiate everything. for example,one of my friends he was caught by police for an offense.he asked police to discount a fine. then,they agreed it easily!  half price!this is unbelievable for Japanese. we obey rules strictly.if you live in shanghai,you will be a good negotiator in many situation. Shanghainese train you how to negotiate especially in business and shopping!you can enjoy it. hehe

This is Yanina from China, I am a simple girl in the complex world.Today, I want to say something about my name. Eight years passed since I entered the college, in the first class of spoken English, I chose Maggie as my English name, because I was a big fun of Maggie Q, she is so beautiful in the film "naked weapon". Then I found there is another Maggie in my class, and some Megan, May, M...we often confuse each other when teacher call our name. So I change my name to Stephine, for the word begin with letter S is goodlooking when sighning names.Not soon, I changed my name to Echo, which is also the name of a famous writer in Taiwan, you must know her writen name "Sanmao", I admire her life in Spain, the desert, the sea island, and also the romantance between her and her husband. But trouble comes after, Echo is not a common girl's English name in foreign countries, people often made the wrong pronunciation when first saw this name, I was tired to correct them again and again, so I change my name to Yanina, easy to speak it out, and the first three letters are just the same as my Chinese given name, the first time I saw this name, I told myself that was for me. Now you know me, Yanina Hou, from China, I'll never change my name again.

these days, I realize seriously how necessary the money is in my life.Since it's quite difficult to keep the balance between studying and working idealy, I've focused on first thing. but shortly after this, I realized that working was also important. without this, I can't manage my daily life. I can't take a bus to school, I can't even have the cheapest lunch in school restaurant. I can't check the text messages and answer the phone as i failed to pay for my cellphone fee.Luckily, I started to work as part-time worker at a bakery which guarantees good payment compared to the work hours.but the case is how to survive until the day of monthly payment. no other choice, I lended money from some of my friends as much as i can keep living until monthly payment.I really can't wait. I owe to many friends of mine and i really want to return the favor by treating them to some delicious cuisine or something.

(and it is fun)Lets create various communities if you do not find the best one!

Walking out of my high school’s dormitory for the last time, I had the both feeling of joy and sorrow. I was happy because I finally finished my senior high school and was going to enter the university. But I felt upset for the fact that I was leaving this memorable place. This dormitory was less a means of living room than an amazing place with unforgettable memories.I started to live in that dormitory in my sophomore year of high school. Our room had 8 beds but only 5 students were living, so there was much extra space in the room. That’s why our friends loved spending their spare time in our room. So from the first day we moved into this dormitory, you could see the scene that at least 10 boys sitting in our room, chatting, and laughing.We had done many interesting things in our dormitory, and the most interesting one was the game of playing “basketball” in the room. We bought a very small dustbin and stuck it to the back of the front door, and it was our “basket”. Also, we brought some ping-pang balls which were used as “basketballs”. From then on, every time we were free, we would play “basketball”. Was it naïve? Yes, I should admit it. But we all loved it and it did bring us joy. We even invited all the boys of our class into our room to play a kind of game called basketball shooting out. Anyone lost would face with the punishment like telling jokes or pretending animals’ behavior, and it made us burst into laughter all the time.Such memorable things always appeared again to my eyesight. I can still remember the day we told jokes one by one and chose who the funniest guy was; I can still remember the day we talked about our favorite NBA team with high emotion till night. And I will never forget that we read books and went over our lessons silently in the room the day before exams; I will never forget that we get together in the room to discuss how to improve study.Friends are people who can share likes and dislikes, joy and sorrow. We felt at ease together and we understood each other. We had a lot of common interests and we could help each other no matter in study or daily life. Once bathed in the warmth of such friendship, you will feel the great power of love.I always considered such kind of getting together as our own party that would never end, but I was wrong. After graduation, we will not live there again. And worse, we were separated because we went to different cities to seek after further study. As the saying goes, we tend to realize the value of what we have had until there is no more of it in our life. Luckily, although we left the high school dormitory, we kept our precious friendship with us. And those days we together were the best experience in my life that I wouldn’t trade for anything. I believe surely that we will get together again and relight the blaze of those happy days.

The other day some relatives came to visit us, one day after breakfast  my parents and i went to pick them up at the hotel they were staying and then we went to a lake near the city, it's about 2 hours from the city,  we stayed a while, and after a ride  on boat we went to  eat in a restaurant in a town near the city, it took us about 3 hours to get there because of the traffic and some rapairs of the highway, but it worthed it,  we  ate something called “Birria”, it's basically  meat of sheep in soup but it's very good though. After that we return at the hotel's lobby to rest a moment, so when it was about 8 o'clock we went to a very famous bar in the city called “El Parian”,we drank some beer and talked, and around midnight we  decided to leave, and went to the hotel again but this time just to let them there and say goodbye to my cousins and uncles and we came home after that. It was a very long day, but it was also kinda fun.

I've not written for a while....(^^;) haha...This time, let me talk about my 3 consecutive holidays. We went out to see a sight colored the leaves by car. The place is most beautiful this season. However, we were stuck up...Many visitors were also heading for the place. (They seemed to have the same plan. lol) The cars didn't move at all! What's worse, these were strung for kilometers behind and forward. Not wanting to waste our time, we changed the plan. We visited a huge park where there is playground equipment. It was a little cold; nevertheless, many families were playing there. :D Needless to say, our son was also excited and his eyes were bright. lolThe next day, I decided to rent a few DVDs and CDs because my husband had to work...After going for a walk, we dropped at a rental shop. I chose "Enchanted". and some CDs of the Christmas songs for kids. The movie is one of Disney films, so it wasn't hard to catch the lines and to understand the story. My son also enjoyed watching. ;DThe last of the holidays was raining...Although I was supposed to stay at home, my husband wanted to go out and talked me into visiting somewhere....Eventually, he won..lolAs we've been carried out drastic reforms for our household expenses like the government and the supplementary budget of our family isn't approved, we can't spend much money. hahahaBut, we went to a big mall because we wanted to check Christmas present for our son. Although it was just window-shopping, as such we enjoyed. lol

I can't remember how many times I've tried to write journals in English regularly. Usually I would tell myself: "You need to improve your written English, you have to write something, if you don't, you will screw up your career sooner or later in the future". My future plan is to get into US graduate schools and study social science, so I made a decision that I would write in English everyday, yet I never carried it out longer than 2 days. However, this time after I discover Lang-8, I decide to try again. I think knowing that someone on the internet will read my journal and correct my mistakes would be a great incentive for me to keep on writing. I also would be very happy if I can help you to improve your Chinese. I used to be a Chinese tutor in college and I have to say that I simply enjoy tutoring. Finally, I would like to write a little bit more about myself. I'm a 24-year girl who enjoys reading the travelling. I appreciate the beauty of language and pledge to myself that I will read my favorite foreignal literatures in their original languages. I cherish friendship and I respect people who have different opinions with me. My favorate quote is Russell's three passion of life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, the unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.

These days I was thinking about what I've done during the last 4 months since I came to Sydney.What confused me is that although I live in here but can't make any local Australian friend=( Every day I just got a few chance to speak English cos all my classmates and friends are Chinese.And today is the first time I feel like my life sucks under the Southern Cross Star that I thought I'm a loser within a huge waste of money and the feedback is a tiny improvement.Although the result of my mid-semester exam is not too bad but I know the good GPA is owe to my A+ Maths that on the opposite side ,my Academic english is only C+.I hate my Academic English teacher,yes, both of them that one of them is a sham gay(I support gay rights but I hate people acting like an absolutely gay says "I hate gay ,they are disgusting" using a sissy tone) and another is a French woman who always talk about sex! Thanks to them for make me fed up with Academic english!!!!!!!On the way back home when I finish the whole day study,I thought about my parents whom working damn hard for support me studing in Australia, I can't help myself stop crying.They are 50 years old already but still working 10 hours a day just for their disappointing daughter whom is a stupit burden....Pressures  make me can't breath maybe flee away is the best choice.

Hello.The reason that I registered on this site is that my friend is studying English on this site.There is word "Mikka Bouzu" in Japan. "Mikka" is three days."Bouzu" is priest in Japanese temple.The priest stoically continues the regular life. The normal person cannot continue them even if it aims at the priest, and will give it up in three days.This episode is an origin of  "Mikka Bouzu".What is "Mikka Bouzu" said in English?The translation site was answered as "Person who cannot stick to anything". I cannot understand whether it is the same meaning. I study English little by little because I want you not to call me "MikkaBouzu".------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------はじめての日記：「三日坊主」って英語で何て言うの？こんにちは。なぜ私がこのサイトに登録したかというと、友人がこのサイトで英語を勉強していたからです。日本には「三日坊主」という言葉があります。「三日」はThree daysのこと。「坊主」は日本のお寺の僧侶、Priestのこと。僧侶は規則正しいストイックな生活を送っています。だけど僧侶を目指す人はそれが続けられずに３日で諦めてしまいます。そこから「三日坊主」という言葉になったのです。英語でも「三日坊主」を意味する言葉はあるんでしょうか。翻訳サイトは「Person who cannot stick to anything」と訳していました。同じ意味かどうかは分かりません。「三日坊主」って呼ばれてもいやなので、ちょっとずつ英語を勉強しようと思います。

Have you heard that singer Lee-Hyo-Lee is called Soon-Sim’s mom? Soon-Sim is a name of an abandoned dog and she is adopted by Lee-Hyo-Lee. As number of people raising pets has increased, number of abandoned pets also increased. According to statistics, the number of people raising pets is almost ten million and the number of abandoned pets is almost hundred thousand a year. Today, I will talk you about the situation of abandoned pets and what should we do for them.   I will start with my personal experience. I have a dog and we have been together for 12 years. When we met first, she is just a little cute puppy. But now she is more than just a pet for me. She is a family member to me. As I raising her, she gives joy to our family and makes us happy. However, raising her also has some hardships. Raising pets requires a great deal of care. Twice a day I should feed her and make her housebroken. Also, raising pets cost too much. Everything for pets normally more expensive than human’s. Especially checking up and some shots for them is really expensive. Therefore although I love her, sometimes raising her is a little burden to me. These are might be the reason that people abandon their pets. That is, expensive registration fees for pets and poor public knowledge of pet care have forced many pet owners to abandon their pets.Now, let me turn to the situation of abandoned pets. In Korea, a hundred thousand pets are being abandoned per year. Some of them are fortunately taken to animal shelter. They stay in there and wait for new owner. However only 20 percent of them are adopted by new owner and the others are euthanized after certain time, about ten days. Also, other abandoned pets would be homeless. There is no food, no safety place for them. In this situation, they might die from hunger or be a road kill.  Then, let’s look at now how should people do for abandoned pets. First, some systems that can connect them with new owner he best solution for them is finding a new owner, so

This is my first participation to Lang-8, and I'm wondering what I could write about...I'm not a beginner at English. At least I can understand almost anything I read in English (my oral comprehension skills are still terrible). I read novels in English, trying to learn every new word I go through, but I terribly lack practice, so here I am! Here I don't fear to make mistakes and take risks reinvesting new words and structures :)Self introductions are boring, don't you think? So, since it's already late here in France, I'll go no further today, and I'll let you discover me within other posts, if you want to. I plan to write a little everyday, so I'll will have plenty of time for introducing me :PSee you tomorrow !

Hi there, I have written this essay and since it´s the first time I do, I would like to know if you could kindly check its structure.“English has become the international language for theTourism industry: the role of translators and interpreters”During the recent years English has became the language of tourism, and since such activity has experienced a worldwide expansion, there has been an increase on the demand for professionals who can provide accurate equivalent sentences from languages deferring from English, in order to let more non-English speaking countries enter into this expanding industry.  Therefore, the role of translators and interpreters is extremely important as professionals who can provide that required service without mistakes leading to misunderstandingsSince an original sentence in a language may not have a literal meaning on English. This is what happens for example with instruction signs originally written in Japanese, where you must put “please” on every imperative sentence, and that pattern is not a must  for English imperative. This English grammar feature is known only by trained professionals, and the same happens with the need of “please” in Japanese imperative sentences; such knowledge is given under training to translators and interpreters who can put together peculiar aspects of two or more languages in order to provide coherent messages, and not sentences in English such as ““PLEASE NO SMOKE IN HERE”, where the natural sentence would be “NO SMOKING”If a sentence hasn´t been translated properly into English, visitors could experience lots of trouble, and visitors expiring trouble, are unhappy visitors. This happens for example when a sentence translated from Japanese into English gave this result: “YOU ARE INVITED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CHAMBERMAID”. Very hilarious, but actually in Japanese that is the way for saying, “SHOULD YOU NEED SOMETHING, PLEASE TELL US”, hence once again the need for people who can properly give the original idea from Japanese in English without giving chance to misunderstandings.Accurately translated sentences will bring ease of communication with your costumers, and of course, it will mean a lot of saved time explaining what was originally intended.  Again, mistranslated sentences will help us, this example was taken from a Japanese to English translation “COOLS AND HEATS: IF YOU WANT JUST CONDITION OF WARM IN YOUR ROOM, PLEASE CONTROL YOURSELF”. Customers may experience distress and may even feel insulted just because the pattern was literally translated from Japanese, a language on which the pattern “By yourself” is correspondent to a single element “Jibun”. There is no need to say that if the translation operation had been done by trained professionals, all that hilarious trouble could have been avoided.Therefore, translators and interpreters play an important role in tourism translation because they are the only professionals capable of sending one idea to English without jeopardizing understanding by literality,  without causing more problems than solutions by mistranslations to customers, and finally because they are trained to provide ease of communication when conveying ideas.

Hey sorry to write something so long, but I really need a brief correction before sending it, I will really apreciate your help!!!The Role of the Youth for Achiveing the Cairo Agenda:	Egypt has proposed a model to be followed by other nations, specially those who are also part of the developing countries and  have similar goals to reach, like control of their economical growth, life standars improvement, respect for the human rights and a better education and health levels. As the youths from around the world get to know better the propositions made by the Cairo Agenda we will be able to better apply them in our own comunities affecting with this the development of international comunities aswell.	Depending on our own original countries, cities and circumstances we have new perspectives of analysis determined by the different times, geographic places and ideologies under which we have been educated, and therefore complement the proposals already formulated by the Cairo Agenda, we, the new generations live with a different disposition before the problems from the world. And depending on our own different abilities we can contribute to reach the objectives and be part of the solution to these problematics.	Our places of origin are different, and present different problems that  are treated with different Solutions. It is necessary to spread internationally this problematics, exposing the situation of each of our own countries and to act like agents of change, learning about new solutions from different points of view to reach the proposed goals.  	Nevertheless, the world undergoes a continuous and inevitable process of globalization, and each time more and more, the human kind, functions like a unique global community at world-wide level, and, no matter the geografic distances we depend on each other to construct a society that respects the values and necessary principles to secure an existence with better life quality, and to assure a future where the differences and individualities are included, supported and respected.	In just a short time we will be the responsible to provide  solutions to the health conflicts, population growth and poor life quality and dignity , for that reason it is important to adapt us to the new exigencies of International crisis; In the youth lays the responsability and capability of  interchanging and spreading the information to come up with the solutions for an optimal population grow as well as dissease prevention, since youth is a segment of the population strongly affected by sexually transmitted diseases. 	We are the direct link to the next generations of children, who require to be educated from as early as possible under the values of respect, gender equality, non-violence, cooperation and measures of hygiene among others.	We can also be a connection between privileged citizens and those  who do not count with the necessary means to solve these problems, or are not aware of the solutions that the global societies are carrying out to face and to contribute to develop life qualities, we are a key link between the problematic premises and the resources to solve them.

The graph shows the annual amount of the wheat exports from 1985 to 1990 in two countries and one region. Wheat export in Australia has been declining for three years straight from 1986 to 1989, though there was a slight rise from 1985 to 1986. It remained mostly in the same from 1989 to 1990. As a whole, wheat export in Australia decreased from 15 million tons to 11 million tons. On the other hand, European community experienced constant rise with exception from 1985 to 1986. In this period, the amount dropped approximately 3 tons from 17tons to 14 tons. Following two years, there was no remarkable rise. But from 1988 to 1990, European community had tremendous rise from 15 tons to 21 tons. Finally, Canada experienced unpredictable up and down in this period. First of all, there was a small down from 1985 to 1986. Following two years, Canada encountered very big rise from 17 tons to 25 tons which was followed by the biggest drastic decline of 11 tons. However, after this extreme decrease, Canada showed amazing resilience. The amount of wheat export increased from 14 tons to 19 tons.

Hi everyone;I'm just getting used to the new office environment including people...(including disregarding what I don't want to get involved in)Only current foes that attack me are... sweets.I'm supposed to improve my English here but...sweats get in my way!!My office has "Office Glico" ...kind of okashi (sweets and not sweets alike) delivery service to the offices probably within Tokyo.Each product sells at 100 JPY.It doesn't have good range of sweets, rather goes the opposite...even though they change the selection once a week.But I end up grabbing one or two of them after struggling with my craving for sweats. Every day.It should add up to a lot of amount of money!Honestly, I think I'm sort of getting bored again here (I'm tired of saying the same thing since my previous job). But I don't want to make it a lame excuse for my health and finances!!However, still thanks to God, I have freedom to write this here instead of focusing on the sweets temptation...But seriously...anyone who has a good idea to fight against this!?!

John Forbes Nash Jr. He was one of the most excellent mathematician who took a Nobel Prize in economic by Nash’s equilibrium theory. The movie ‘Beautiful Mind’ shows the Nash’s dramatic life, from Nash entered the Princeton graduate school. John Nash is a schizophrenic. As any other schizophrenic, Nash also suffered from hallucinations. He couldn’t distinguish the real world and false world. In the movie, Nash thought that he had a great mission against the Soviet Union by analyzing the secret code word. However the mission was vision and all his behavior was unnecessary. As time goes on, Nash noticed that he has phantasm, and tried to overcome the situation. After all, he surmounted his mental disorder, and became the man who was upstanding all over the world. I was deeply moved by watching ‘Beautiful Mind’ especially, John Nash’s life. Sometimes, we envy the person who has a gift. In normal times, we are apt to ask someone’s IQ(intelligence quotient). And if he or she got a high IQ index, we feel envy of it. In short, we can easily understand that genius is happy. However, John Nash is not blissful. John seems to be pressed for time, achievement all days. He abhorred losing game. He doesn’t have any sense to hit it well with other student. Take a view of Nash’s life, I think John Nash is not only the person who has a super brain but also has highest patience and persistence. After Watching ‘Beautiful Mind’, I ask my mother who is a psychiatrist about schizophrenia. She told me that almost schizophrenics are prone to quit on life. Nash was subjected to humiliation all days. Yet Nash try to overcome his situation instead blame his life. Also I was really impressed about his affections for his wife. Of course without wife's effort, Nash couldn't got a huge honer. But I was more attracted to Nash's love style. In the last scene of the movie which Nash made a speech, I had goose bumps all over. He shows his gratitude to his wife, and gave me a great inspiration of love. Maybe John Nash was a gorgeous man and he will be remembered forever.From now on, I will never do not care for mental patient, and I truly help them for they win against all obstacles. Also I hope that society eliminate discrimination for metal patient.2009/10/5

Internet has changed our lives in many different ways, one of them is shopping. Online shopping has become very popular in recent years. Nowadays it’s highly developed in some sectors like transport, hotels etc. But it’s still used by a minority in many other sectors like clothing, food etc.The greatest benefit of online shopping is that it allows us to buy things very quickly and without the need to move to the shop. So online shopping saves us a time and money.Another point in favour of this technology is that it facilitates the trade, because it allows us to buy things very far away produced.In addition online shopping has promoted the exchange of products between private people through websites like Ebay.One downside is that nowadays people who did no have access to Internet connexion have many difficulties to buy some things on their own.Another drawback is the lose of work positions and the impersonality, because the client never meet the seller and this could increase the number of swindles.On the whole online shopping is a great invention, the benefits are more much important than the drawbacks and I think that in the future we are going to buy almost every thing using online shopping.

Hello there, my name is Jane. I've been learning English ever since I can remember myself. I crammed it at school, then I entered the State Pedagogical University, where I majored in it.

My band is called Equal Rights and we're doing ska-reggie-dub-hip-hop-funk. Here I want to post some of our lyrics, all written by me.

If the entry's too long don't correct everything, just correct a few paragraphs or give me some useful tip.Some weeks ago the Starcraft beta was released by Blizzard, apparently you had to sign in with your Battle.net account in order to recieve some validation key.I waited cause I know people were gonna crack it, and so they did.I thought I wasn't gonna be able to run cause I only have an onboard graphics card, but it came out nicely.My thoughts about it:When I started playing a map came up right away, and a race was assigned randomly, on my first try the Zerg came up. They changed almost everything about them, most upgrades, most units and most buildings were changed.For example the Queen now is a land unit instead of an air unit (wtf) the Hydralisk is an advanced unit and the Ultralisk is way tougher.On the second try the Protoss came out. Most of their structures remain the same but their air units are all different, the Carrier seems to stay unchanged though. Dark templars are here but they don't merge into the Dark Archon, instead they merge into a normal Archon just like the High Templars. The Dragoons have been removed, and damn the Arbiter was removed, that was one of my favorite units from the original Starcraft.I did hate one unit that was similar to the new Collossus but smaller, it seemed too "insectish" and it didn't look Protoss at all.I haven't tried the Terran out yet.In conclusion the game is still under development but I doubt the final version will be too different from the Beta, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed, but since I liked the original Starcraft so much I had asumed SC2 was gonna be worse.On my next entry I'm gonna talk about Diablo 3, and my expectations on that game.Thanks for your time.

   TV shopping become one of modern means by which people do their shopping. Convenience is why it is popular , which is also controversial topic for consumers.   Some people accept TV shopping because it makes them shopping at home. They could choose goods what they need by TV Shopping advertisements. And they could pay a bill by remit money.    I do not like TV Shopping. Because there are too much frauds in TV Shopping. In TV Shopping advertisement the performance of their goods is usually exaggerated. The price of a simple thing is usually quite expensive. The after-sale of TV Shopping usually bad, someone is even no.

Hi everybody! I'm Carla and I'm from Valencia, Spain. Yesterday, I thought: "I have to practice my English!" So I am here. I wanted to write something in this website, but I do not have any idea. So I thought to start a kind of diary. However, when I was a child I started a lot of diaries, and... well, I only wrote two or three pages.But this is different. It is writen in English! I think it could be... funny? Interesting? I don't know! Time will say it.How can I start? As I said, my name is Carla. I have eighteen years old and this is my first year at the University. Now, we have just started the second term, and I have changed completely all the subjects. Last term I had English, Spanish, Catalan, Traductology and Classic Culture. Now, I have English, too, Linguistics, Literature, Technology and Philosophy- don't ask me why I have it.This week I knew some of the results of the exams. I have an A in three of them!- I don't know the others yet.I am watching the time and I realise that... I have a lot of homework! I have to read two texts, do a summary for the English class and write a letter for an English friend (I will tell my visits to England another time). I think... Maybe the next time it could be called "A kind of autobiography"!Bye!

THE DECISION - Part one.By Dedalo.He had never been there before until that day. It was the day when everything happened. He was there looking out of the window, everything was quiet; he could not hear the noise on the street, but just the silence in his room. He looked for this special room away from all that annoying noise. Beautiful silence, all thatHe needed, just peace, peace in his mind.He needed time to think, Just a couple of hours to clear his mind, there's always a struggle in the life of a man when he must decide between what's fair and what's right, and the fair or right choice is not always obvious;  so this was the right moment to look inside himself, to look into the depths of his heart,  and then wonder, what must  I do?. His mistake is the misery of someone else,   but there's not much time,  opportunities come only once and never come back again, they are like a wind that touches your face just once, the next current of wind is always different from the first one.

I like baseball very much. I mean just watching games. So, I usually watch baseball games on TV whenever I have a freetime after work.I like player Park Chanho. He is well known for the first korean to play in the major and his fastball that gave him a nickname 'Orient express' when he debuted in 1994.He had played for 17 years in major league.  I think he made a remarkable record not only in Korean baseball history but also in Major's.  Anyway, He moved to Orix Buffaloes of Japanese baseball league this year.I wish he can achieve better performance in this season.

The gay marriageNowadays, People have the right to get married, it is a right for everyone but what do you think about the gay marriage?Firstly, some people same that everyone have the right to be happy and the law is the same for all. For that reason, there should not matter the sexual orientation.Besides, many experts believe that children raised by homosexual couples grow as well as children raised by heterosexual couples.However, religious people think that God only created man and woman to form a family.Also, many people say that the adoptation only be allowed to heterosexual couples because children could be confused in a gay marriage.Personally, I think the gay marriage is not a religious topic and all people have the right to get married without discrimination.

Today I decided to make my hairs shorter, because I become look like an emo. Thus I called to the hairdresser salon and they agreed to cut my hair today. I don't know a certain hairdresser in this saloon, so I didn't know who will cut my hairs. I came to salon on time. I sited on chair and waited my specialist. Then she came. She was very glamorous and hot. Although her face wasn't so attractive to me, her grooming compensated this issue, Here in Novosibirsk, many people don't have a habit to be well-groomed. Small number of young girls visit solarium. And then she started to make her job. Since she started I noticed she is newbie. Her movings wasn't confident. Also I noticed she often touched me, her small cold fingers slided on my face and I liked it. And her legs very often cuddled to my knees and I liked it too. I really wanted her. I started to find a way to meet with her. But she was on a job and, probably, private talk with clients is banned. Then her scissors broke. Screw unscrewed and fell down. I think it is great shame for hairdresses. At the end, she dried my hairs and smudge some gel. I was satisfied my new haidress. I said her: "Ok, normal...(then I saw she was unhappy)..good", and smiled to her.   I payed 400 roubles(~$13) for this job. I asked her name. And she's name was Valeria. I don't know will I come to her again. But as girl, she very interested to me.

With the development of the film industry, nowadays, people are facing more alternatives in a ticket office than ever before. Whether you should choose a movie that will make you laugh to tears, or to choose to a serious one that deals with the issue of global warming? As far as I’m concerned, the decisive factor should be whether you can learn something from it. This is for the following reasons.First of all, movies provide us chances to experience various life experience and life styles vividly that few other forms of mass media can compare. For most of us, we can only grow up in one family, have one mother and one father, doing one job and choosing one life style in our life time. Movies, however, make it possible for us to live a complete different life: the life of single mother, the hardship of being an entrepreneur, or even grow up in an exotic country! Thus, by watching a movie, you will obtain a new respect of life.Also, watching movies is an ideal way to learn about a different country. As for me, I am an economic major, who have always being curious about the cause of the financial crisis in 2008, and have a lot of puzzles in my heart. After watching a movie named “inside job”, my confusions are solved and I felt astonished by the truth the movie revealed. I can’t imagine how can I get to know all these facts about the American from China, if it were not for the movie. Some people may argue that movies are created to provide entertainment rather than education. Apparently, there is great truth in this statement. What is equally true, however, is that we don’t have to give up our right of recreation, while learning something from the movie. Kids can be amused by KongFu Panda’s funny movements, but that doesn’t prevent them from learning something about Chinese Culture. Teenagers can get into rapture when High School Musical shows on the screen, but that doesn’t stop them gain a feeling of what friendship is all about. Adults can enjoy the visual concussion of the Avatar, but it doesn’t conceal the fact that they also feel the urge to respect the nature. Compare with those movies which offer mere entertainment, the movies mentioned above are superior in more ways than one. Some friends of mine are movies fanatic, and they are forever talking about how gorgeous the actress is or how rare is that emerald in the movie. I always shrug my shoulder when I hear any of these. To me, these movies are just trying to impress audience by providing them false picture of reality and are basically meaningless. Why people would let go such a great opportunity to be educated while experiencing great amount of relaxation at the same time, is beyond me. Hence, I’m deeply convinced that people should only watch movies that teach us something about real life.

He might have smoked a little less; this could have made the difference. Doesn´t matter now, may be nevertheless that his dead being a legacy of life for my. In spite of all, we must have had a very good relationship. He might have learned to me to paint beautiful paintings as he, while both take a cup of coffee together. I must imagine that my grandfather had a lot of patience for painting and therefore might have patient for to teach me. I like me drawing, may be because to my grandfather too like made it.

Hey,everyone.i have a question which really bothers me lately.could anyone tell me what does the sentence "where are you up to"mean.because someone said it means like where're you going and some people said:  "I suggest that 'Where are you up to?' means: How far have you got? You could ask this when you want to know how far someone has got in reading a book, following a series of exams and so on. If you want to know what someone is doing at the moment, you could ask: What are you up to these days?"i don't know which is the correct anwser.sincerely looking forward for your help.

Today, I started to read the book I bought yesterday. It's called "Les kanjis dans la tête" : it is the French version of "Remembering the Kanji" (by James Heisig), written by Yves Maniette.During last months I learned ひらがな (hiragana) and カタカナ (katakana). Then I looked for a good method to begin 漢字 (kanji). As usual, that took me a while, because I want to compare every book, every method, reading opinions on every forum I could find. I spent much more time for Kanji because learning more than two thousand ideograms the bad way could be, well, "catastrophic".I wondered if I should learn main pronunciations or if I should follow Heisig and Maniette's thoughts : just associate a kanji with a keyword and some "sesames".Finally, I decided to use the kdlt book with Anki, a spaced repetition system.I have to say that the book is really beautiful. It worthes its price. And the method seems to work well ! I learned twenty-five kanji today, and if I didn't want to take my time I would have learnt more. It's really exciting, and easy to read.I should know all of the 2064 kanji the book teaches in about three months. I know the most part of the work is to learn words using these characters, because, in opposition to English, I don't read Japanese every day, I know just about ten words, and there aren't "transparent words". But let's think about that later. :)

I am always wondering the word "suppose" sounds rude or not.When I used the word in e-mail at one occasion, my pen pal has never written again to me. I don't remember how I used the word in a sentence though, since then I am always wondering the word "suppose" is rude.I will appreciate it very much if you could comment or give me an example how to use "suppose" in a rude manner and also a good manner.Thanks.

In this day and age, modern technology like computer has fundamentally changed people’s life. People use computers to search information and deal with massive work. Besides, computer is changing people’s life style. An increasing number of people start to work at home using computer. However, I can’t say it is completely true that working at home using computer or telephones is better than working in the office. First, computers contain office software as well as recreational functions. If one is not self-disciplined, it is easy for them to lose track of time when they use the internet at home. Take my friend Emily as an example, she is a columnist. Once she worked at a newspaper office. Chatting on line, watching movies or browsing irrelevant websites are not allowed during work time, so she has to just focus on her work. But this year she started to work at home. She writes articles at home and sends them to editors by e-mails. I thought this would be great as she doesn’t need to spend time on commute. However, she told me that at home she can’t help logging on msn and chatting with people or browsing irrelevant websites, sometimes she even plays computer games. As a result, she gradually became a procrastinator. These days she often starts to finish her tasks near deadlines. Second, working at home makes people isolated. Working in the office provides an opportunity to get along with colleagues. And sometimes colleagues can be good friends, which brings lots fun. In contrast, working at home will damage people’s health physically and mentally as they move less and mostly stay alone. Working at home seems more convenient yet makes people distant from each other. I have to admit that modern technology like computer and telephone do bring convenience to people’s life. They enable people to work at home and make schedules more freely. However, I still believe that the defects of working at home outweigh its merits since there is no guarantee that working at home enhance proficiency yet does exert detrimental influence upon physical and psychological soundness of people.

{Before correcting my text, would anyone please give me a few synonyms of the following expressions?"organic-cotton""products""retailers""fibre""insufficient production""shrink bit by bit"" for the moment."}How green is your wardrobe?Eco-friendly products are more and more appealing to consumers, especially regarding apparel.Textile products made using organic cotton gained a huge popularity in the market.The ecological assets of these products made them fashionable for purchasers but also for both producers and shopkeepers who try to improve their image.Although major retailers feel confident about this special fibre, most producers cannot afford adapting to organic-cotton industry because they fear that demands may prove ephemeral, which has recently led to an insufficient production. As a result, only a pricey small range of products made of organic-cotton are available for the moment. Notwithstanding/STILL, additional charges should shrink bit by bit and  organic-cotton textiles are expected to compete with ordinary cotton in the next few years.Nonetheless, a spate of fake organic-cotton, seemingly impossible to stop, is spreading on the market according to textile industry executives.Wether or not organic-cotton is only a short term fashion is not sure for the moment.

Please be extremely strict when correcting this text. Thanks!Hey friends!Since I joined this social network I’ve always written my posts in Japanese but today I’ll give English a chance! I’d like to tell you all about something that ocurred a few days ago and that will likely change my life for the better.To fully understand what I’m about to say let’s go back to January for a moment, when I took an interview seeking to participate in a course on innovation and leadership that would be held at my university. According to what people familiar with the matter said to us, after a 4-month period of hard work the students who proved oustanding leadership skills and an uncanny ability to learn would be picked up and sent to different parts of the world to do an internship in the most innovative companies.I was luckly to finally be selected to take part in that particular adventure and I committed to myself to go after that internship and to strive to make my dream of working for a big bank come true.A lot has happened since January. 3 guys and I formed a team and we’ve been working together one session after another. Besides my team mates, they have become my friends. Now they are people I know I can trust and whom I’m sure I will received support from when necessary.Last week I received a call from the person who was in charge of the selection process and asked me one of the most easy-to-answer questions I have ever been asked: “Would you like to work in one of the largest Asian banks next summer?”OF COURSE I WOULD!!!!!!!!It looks like I’ll be working for Bank Mega in Jakarta for 2 months starting on July, 1st. I’ll be using English on a daily basis and thus I decided to brush it up here on Lang-8 ;-)Well... why was I selected? Here is what I think.To be honest with you, I’m not a smart guy. I’m not the kind of student that consistently rises his hand in class and comes up with all the right answers. I don’t have good grades and I don’t even enjoy my classes. Despite studying information technology engineering I know this is not the place I’d like to be. In fact, I have no doubt that once I graduate from university I’ll do something which will bear little or no connection with what I’m currently studying at school.However, I think I’m an intelligent guy. As I said, I don’t have all the answers but... you know what? I do have the right questions. Sometimes it’s not about knowing everything (it’s technically impossible to know everything) but about asking the right questions to the right people. I once was told –or maybe I just read it– that those who now raise their hands and know all the answers will eventually end up working FOR someone who may not be good at solving difficult physics problems but can get and lead the right people effectively towards an even better solution. That’s the type of person I’d like to become.In this Akademia program (the course I took) it was not wisdom what was rewarded, but zeal. The zeal to learn and the potential to thrive internal and externally.Finally I’d like to share some words from Thomas L. Friedman, the 3-times-winner of the Publitzer prize. In his fantastic book “The World is Flat”, Friedman speaks about how the world has changed and why you’re no longer competing for a job position against people from your own city or country. The truth is that you’re now competing against every inhabitant of the world. There’s no room for “a Spanish job” or a “Japanese job”. Those kind of jobs have simply disappeared.One more thing this incredibly brillian journalist tells us in his book is that in a flat world, IQ is gradually giving way to CQ, which stands for Curiosity Quoficient. All your IQ lets you do will be probably outsource to India or China and now it’s your Curiosity Quoficient, your genuine and intense passion for learning new things what really counts out there.I won’t be in Jakarta because of my IQ. I will be there thanks to my CQ.In other words: I won’t be in Jakarta because I know everything. I will be there because I’d love to know it.Thanks for reading my long post and I wish you all a great weekend.P.S. If any of you know anything about Bank Mega please leave a comment! If you don’t, leave it anyway ;-) they are always appreciated.For my original blog please go to: http://guille.exblog.jp

Nadya we are friends a long time, for 30 years, with the first class.We are with her and look like, and the problem we have with it is the same: just can not find a good job. Everything was out of luck. But fate smiled at us.One day we were sitting with Nadya in the square in front of Kazan Cathedral, and remember our past failures and the work has not built any prospects. The benches in the square were empty and wet. There were few tourists. In November, the weather does not have to rest on the benches.  And it gets dark early in St Petersburg, at four o'clock already night. .- Good  evening... - suddenly sat down next to us an intelligent man. - What a evening? Four hours of the day - snapped at him Nadya, as he reason she did not like. - Good day ... - recovered from a stranger, but this time did not receive a reply. I wanted him to answer the greeting, but the man was sitting with Nadya`s hand, and was so impressed that he spoke with her, not me. - I you have already seen ... - he went to get acquainted with the Nadya of not paying attention to me. -  I saw you last summer in the garden. More then I wanted to meet you. You see, I - the owner of a fashion store. I really need the employee with an attractive appearance. I suggest you work in my boutique. Do not go back immediately ...! In any case, I invite you to her friend (a man and I sent a radiant smile) to visit my store clothes. That card with the address boutique. Maybe make a purchase ...And the employer is left. - Please? - Check it out!

 Hi, my name is Sebastián. This is the first time I write here at Lang-8, and to be honest it’s hard for me to decide  what to talk about, but if you don’t make up your mind and practice you’ll never improve, so here I go… I’m studying English and Japanese. I use the computer and internet a lot for studying, which has given me access to several and great tools that every language learner should have access to, like blogs, forums, podcasts, sowftware and others.. As for English, its pronunciation is hard, but reading isn’t that much hard. Besides, on internet there are amazing amounts of information in English about any subject. For example, I like stuff related to the use of computers and internet for both leisure and learning, and read sites like Lifehacker and Wikipedia  and several others everyday. Actually, I’ve learned a lot of English by reading and writing at sites about learning Japanese. On the other side, reading Japanese is something that takes lots of time and effort. Even something as “simple” as reading the newspaper isn’t that “simple” at all. Fortunately, I study kanji using a book called “Remembering the Kanji” by James Heisig, and also spaced repetition softwares for kanji and Japanese in general, which has helped me a lot not just to actually learn, but also to feel much more motivated to keep on learning. As I said above, the use of the computer and internet has helped me a lot. I think this is the best moment to learn languages, as practically anything you need can be found on internet, and even for free. For example, Lang-8 is a great tool for every language learner, so I hope it keeps on having great success. ¿What do you think?

West Lake, one of the most famous places of interests, lie in the southwest of Hangzhou. It is a good description of this densely wooded, rich and warm city of China.You can cross the Yangzi-Triangle Plain by train, which will just take one and twenty minutes from SH, a metropolitician city. For the best view of the West Lake, take a boat, wandering in the water that will at times seem never-ending. You can embark on the train any time from Shanghai Southern Railway Station, in the southern part of this city, by Line-3 or Line-1 from downtown. If you'd like to enjot the long stretch of countryside nearby, I recommend you to take a slower train at  a nice comfortable speed, where you still get to see the countryside rolling by.After a short sleep, a middle size but convenient city will finally rise up in the end. Even though it does not have subway like Shanghai, you can find that the transportation here is even better than you expect. Hope all of you will have a nice trip in Hangzhou, my second hometown!

Climatic consequences of major nuclear war was the subject of a study,  conducted by United Nations during 1987-1988. According this study, use of nuclear weapons  could affect the climate of areas that are far away from the Ground Zero regions. The conclusion , based on scientific data, is that the major nuclear war will lead to threat of global environmental disruption.  Possible quantitative consequences are the follows: significant reduction of sunlight and heat, that reach the earth’s surface, because of dust, smoke and soot,  presenting in the atmosphere. In some areas,  deviation from the normal weather patterns could be observed, which will result in the appearance of new regions with unusually low temperature or lack of precipitations, which directly affect the rops.			Direct impact of nuclear explosions and global consequences of major nuclear war on the environment will make a process, where each factor would exacerbate the other.   Direct consequence of major nuclear exchange could be death of millions people; its indirect influence may lead to death of billions. Therefore, survivers will face not only destructive  aftermath of the war, but  cold, toxic pollutans, radioactive fall-out, breakdown in food supplies  and lack of (harmless) potable water.  Nuclear exchange could also lead to significant exhaustion of protective ozone layer  in stratosphere, which increase intensity of ultraviolet  radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface.  And this, could make big troubles for injured life form (or living organisms).  The others global effects of major nuclear exchanges for environment could also be determined.

Day before yesterday, 2010 world cup continental heat was finished.Everything goes as we expected but amazing problem occurred in the end.Thierry Henry, a great French striker, made a mistake.He touched the ball. And the ball was 'handed out' to his teammate William Gallas. then he got the game point. France defeated Ｉreland.As you might know, this news spread quickly to the world.In Japan, Henry was known to people who isn't interested in football as a dirty player.In addition to this, Ireland's prime minister requested FIFA to play over against France.(This request was not granted.)His only one mistake resulted serious problem.However,  I believe the French didn't intentionally break the rules. It is natural for sportsman especially uses ball to respond.He got many titles in his career such as MVP and Getting high scores in England. His goal brought innumerable win to his team.I can't think such a great player breaks the rules in person. In other words, a person who is dirty,not serious to football can't get such a excellent career.What do you think? Please give me some opinions.Thank you for reading!

Hi!This is my fist writing on this page. I've been studying English for some time, you know to master a language many skills are necessary such as speaking, listening, reading and writing. These are the so famous 4 skills to learn languages and sometimes it can be really hard to master them.However, it also depends on the amount of time that you dedicate to learning the language which you're interested on. It's obvious that you won't reach a good level in a short time if you don't practice a few hours everyday.It is said that some languages are easier to learn. In my opinion, it also depends on your native language. For example for many westerners is a lot easier to learn English,French,Italian and Spanish because these languages come from Latin, being known as romance languages. But learning Chinese, Korean or Japanese can be hard as hell, cause we aren't familiar with those weird,strange symbols.So, for Japanese people is really hard learning English because they aren't familiar with most words and their pronunciation isn't as flexible as English pronunciation.When I became aware of this page I thought that it could be very handy to practice my English as well as my Japanese and in exchange, help many people learning my native language which it is Spanish.So, thank you very much for reading my first writing in English. :DAh! by the way, my nickname is Michard,nice to meet you. (though this should have been written at the beginning and not at the end but i forgot it XD).

This text is my assignment at the English school.Takashi was 6th grader of elementary school in Chiba prefecture. After school, he went to the cram school which is one hour away from home every day.　The cram school is so far away that he had little time to play with his friends, but he thought the cram school was fun. Because there was a wonderful teacher he liked. This young teacher encouraged and commended him. Most importantly, the teacher gave him a dearest dream. The teacher told him, "If you study hard, you will enter the famous junior high school in Tokyo. So, he studied hard every day. One day, he said to his mother when he returned home from school, " Everyone trained for the athletic meet." He wanted to train, but he had to go to the cram school, so he didn’t. He wanted to win a prize at the athletic meet. He felt very sad. His mother asked him, “Which race do you want to take part in? He answered, “I want to take part in the 100 meter dash.” During talking about the race, his mother came up with a good idea. She said, “If you use your head, you win the race.” He asked, “What do you mean?”

It's being like... eight years since I last studied English at highschool (or anywhere, now that I think about it). Thankfully, all this time I haven't stopped reading it on the internet, and listening to American and English television series.Around a month ago, I decided I'm gonna take the TOEFL exam on december. Not only because I want to know what my real level is, but also because I'm gonna need the results on april when I start asking for a scholarship for my postgraduate studies abroad. I started taking all the TOEFL and Proficiency tests I could find, and I'm glad to see my reading and listening comprehension are very high. I'm also quite confident about my speaking (although a little bit concerned about my pronunciation, but I'm gonna practice talking with a buddy), but the writing part of the exam gives me goosebumps.I can express myself properly, but can I do it using such complicated words and grammar to convince the examiners that I'm worth a 100+ in my ibT? I tend to write quite plain, it's not that I can't use some impressive vocabulary and phrasal verbs (lol), but I usually forget them. So... time for practice!I'm using Anki (it's a very useful software wich uses memory algorithm based on spaced repetition learning) with a vocabulary deck to learn/review some difficult and showy words, just in case ;).Now I know the body of athletes is lithe, that when I get my 100+ it'll be a momentous event, and that an argument that doesn't hold water is the way you translate the "hacer aguas" expression in spanish.Please be really extrict with my written expression, not only with the faults I commit, but also tell me how would you say anything that sounds weird. Thank you very much!!

So, he has told me a lot of interesting facts about Bushmen and I has been really interested to watch movie about them.Yestarday evening film was successfully downloaded and I got really pleasent watching this old movie. I starded loving Bushmen even more - they are so smile, so naive. Plot of the film is simple and not very intriguing but hilarious. It is about one Bushmen who go to "the end of the Earth" in order to get rid of bad thinkg (bottle of coca-cola) that has made trobles in his tribe. There are also one funny personage - scientist who afraid of speaking with woman.I can recommend "God must be crazy" for everebody who likes hoax, nature and old movies.

Today, I want to talk about my favorite soccer player.My favorite soccer player is Raul who plays for Spanish La Liga club Real Madrid.Do you know him?He is known as one of the great strikers in this world. His play style is a little different from general great strikers. Actually, he is not so fast like Cristiano Ronaldo,Messi. And he dosen't have strong muscles. But he strikes a goal. I attributes the reason why he can get many goals to the motion before he receive a pass around the penalty area.  In that area, he moves very quickly and efficiently to shoot easily. Then the defender feels he has vanished. This motion is difficult to explain.Now he is 31. It seems old for a soccer player but he still has been a great striker. So I love his play and want to cheer him.

A recent movie recall my memories of like,eighth grade(the 3rd year in junior middle school)? We were assigned to write an article about dreaming.   Then next week on the first period, the teacher was so furious to declare that she found someone's work was definitely the copies from outsiders' public paper.  From thus,I confirmed that there is no such absolutely just recognization really happened so much so often.  And to cheering up the creativity (of the piece of work which is goooood enough to be identified as a knockoff ), I thought I do earn myself a little more boast : people think and act in their routine, that's why they often hide their motivation and always persuade others NOT TO do sth beyond understanding. As time goes by,I find no matter what the truth is,people only see what they want to see.   So, that will be a tough project to make everyone surround you do your interst without hesitation (PS: forgive my abuse of western language if it might be).  They might strike you when you give a prospectus, they just say the opposite when the critical time comes,they can do anything abnormal and trust it or not,always accompanied by reasons.  Is the way as similar as we conclude ?--if one sets his mind to do sth,sooner or later he can find his path & means .The point is we make mistakes,finding ourselves spending time in proving to others that we're not stupid which, on the contrary do the uselessness.The harder we try the more hopeless we feel.  Time flies we all have to move on.  We so bond to have because we are born with nothing and deny failure unconscious of the fact that everything begin with a trust.   So...again,let's spare the time of acknowledging and do it though hard. Last month the Africa PD wanted to have a guy enrolled for him in response to the "dissonance" of the team.Saying this,I never think my english is good,I do not know what is the professional band 8 for,especially when you see so many graduates who was practicing language training from 7 just like us but still don’t know how to extend it.And mostly,I figured all of the world,people communicate without useing word merely,it’s… sort of heart,perhaps.  So like other stupid certification which I might wanna to gain through examination in Oct,I never think it’s a must.Even that I do not speak the beautiful accent like 10years ago,even if I can not express myself clearly to win your support any longer,I just keep the right way I am,and I just believe everyone who has his own will be loved by his circle and destiny.I like the people who accept challenge and willing to explore his extrem. PLUS : this is supposed to be a talk big,but it's not.u r taking the risk of ignoring many so-ture experiences if you think it is.

Major in Teaching Chinese As A Foreign Language, it is my first time to be a tutor for a foreigner to help improve her Chinese. She doesn't know any of Chinese and it is hard for us two (yes, we have two tutors for one student) to teach her. What's more, though we have been professionally studying English for nearly two year, it is still hard for us to express exactly what we want to say in English, especially when we want to explain the questions she meets in learning Chinese. What a huge blow! My friend and I have decided to be more dedicated in English learning. I have given up French already. But for English, I love its beauty and don't want to give it up. So, work harder, girl!

Today I found Lang-8 on the web, and I was so interested.I am webmaster of a radio station in Tokyo.  Everyday we play worlds' songs,  but most of us doesn't understand its' lyrics, maybe.One of my partner on job is from America, but his Japanese E-mails are perfect.  So I reply to him in English, but it takes three-times more time than in Japanese (and maybe also he feels difficulty in reading my mail).So, today I stop to use our best business partners as my English teacher!   Instead, start Lang-8.Your courtesy helps my business and Tokyo's NO.1 FM station!Thank you.

So this is my first story about me. My name is Dasha. My family consists of two persons: me and my mother. Her name is Svetlana.  I have studied many languages (French, German, Polish), but choose English and Japanese. Why? Because I fell in love with the pronunciation of these languages. Oh, I've got sore throat and I feel dizzy... I will go to sleep. Please correct my mistakes.

I know little about soccer.So this June is not a special month for me.But my husband insisted on my watching the World Cup on TV with him.After he took almost 10 minutes to explain the word "offside" ,he gave up the idea that soccer can be taught to his wife.In fact when I watch the games,I can also get fun.I enjoy the exciting moment when the ball is getting closer to the goal.And thanks to the high speed cameras,I laugh a lot.They capture too many funny faces and funny moves.But there is also something disappointed me. I always thought soccer field with clean green grass was so beautiful.But I was wrong.Players spit to it.In the game,they spit saliva.When the game is over,they gargle and spit the water.Even a player spat out a chewing gum.I saw him chewing it during his game.Isn't it a dangerous thing?And I must say something about the noisy horns in stadium.In TV stream,they turn to a sound like millions of flies flying around my ears.That almost kills me.

Today, I'd like to write on a topic most Japanese learners know little about: pitch accent. Per se, this isn't a personal journal entry as much as a sort of tutorial for the sake of fellow students. To keep it short, I will only briefly touch on certain aspects. Feel free to ask me to elaborate if you have questions. Students are usually taught that Japanese doesn't have stress, unlike English, and that sentences present a rather flat pattern. Unfortunately, that's simply not true. Japanese phrases present a series of high or low syllables that follow certain rules. The default pattern is that the first syllable of a word will be low, followed by high syllables until a downfall occurs. A downfall is a point where a high syllable is followed by a low syllable. Not all words contain a downfall, and whether a given word contains a downfall or not -- and where it is -- must be learned by heart. However, how pitch changes as particles or morphemes are added is predictable.You don't usually need to follow those rules to be understood (save a few exceptions where pitch alone allows a distinction between 2 or 3 otherwise identical sounding words); however, ignoring them will forever confine you to having a foreign accent.Let's look at the verb to eat, taberu, as an example.If we use capitals to mark high syllables, the proper standard Japanese pronunciation of this verb is taBEru. In the negative, we get taBEnai. No surprise here. However, the -te form becomes TAbete. -tai form becomes taBETAi.Why the variation?Pitch is determined from the end of the verb and is assigned by the morpheme added at the end. -nai is a -3 morpheme, which means that the 3rd syllable from the end will be a downfall. Since -nai itself is 2 syllables, it's the previous one that will be high. -te is also a -3 morpheme; however, -tai is -2.Notice also how the second syllable in taBETAi is high too. In standard Japanese (this isn't true in Kansai-ben), the first two syllables must always have a different pitch, so unless the first syllable is high, you will get a low-high pattern. The following syllables will stay high until we reach the downfall.KAeru (to return home) will work the same way, even though the downfall occurs on a different syllable in the dictionary form. Can you guess what the -nai, -te and -tai forms will look like?kaERAnaikaEttekaERITAiThough some of these forms may be surprising, actually, they follow the pattern perfectly. Notice that double consonants count as 2 syllables, which explains ka.E.t.te.If you follow these rules, you will always be able to determine the pitch of a verb with a downfall. I said "verb with a downfall" because verbs without a downfall follow a different pattern (-nai is -2, -te is -0 and -tai is -2). The good news is that these are the only 2 patterns.Listen carefully. You should now start hearing this.

The problem of child’s development is very important today. The main reason of this problem is accelerated life rhythm. Adults do not have enough time for their kids and this fact means that children feel lack of parents’ attention and care.On the one hand, parents are have the general role in children’ life because every child spend lots of time with his relatives. When somebody communicate with another person for a long time it plays important role in development of person’s character.  On the other hand, present life rhythm is much more accelerated than in the past. It means that parents have no choice and they stay his child (or children)  with nannies, classmates and so forth. These persons are very important part of children’ development on different life stages. For example, your classmates’ habits can became your. We talk about both types of habits: useful and unuseful (smoking and such). Thirdly, each of contemporary mass media is very effective in entertainment and informing people. But people can become addicted of these thins. One of significant today’s problems is the Internet addiction. Children spend lots of time in the network but they do not do any useful business. They just waste their time or/and money. I want to say that we have to find ways for right developing children. Cause - they are a new generation, a future and we have to think about our future and perspectives of our society. We should develop some labour laws for protecting people with kids. We must create new methods of controlling content and interaction in the Internet for eliminating the “network-addiction” syndrome.

Travelling abroad is more and more popular in China now.The number of people travelling abroad has increased rapidly since 1996,thanks to the development of economy.In my opinion,travelling abroad is agreeable.But some Chinese tourists behave badly in public.On the grassland,you may find some Chinese tourists throwing rubbish here and there,which makes the palce dirty.Sometimes some Chinese tourists spit at a venture.These behaviors are not impolite.I don't like them at all.Though China is making rapid progreess in economy, in honsty,none of countries will welcome it if some Chinese people still behave badly in public.It's our duty to develop a good habit in public to get rid of bad behaviors,and to make China a more powerful country.

It is the first time I'm writing here, so I’m a bit nervous. I learn English mostly by myself. We study it at school, but our teacher usually corrects only the grossest mistakes and pays absolutely no attention to pronunciation. And as we have only two English lessons per week, it’s impossible to know language any good. So I can say that it were two wonderful writers, Oscar Wilde and Stephen Fry, who taught me English. Sounds really pompous, doesn’t it? :) But it is true. These are two men who made me really interested in English, who made me realize how beautiful this language can be.The story of falling in love with another language I learn, German, is much simpler. I heard people speaking it and that exact moment I realized that I loved it and wanted to learn it. I’ve been learning it for two years now, it’s much harder than English for me, I don’t really get how adjectives change depending on cases and my vocabulary is just ridiculous. But then I imagine how hard it is for foreigners to learn my native language, Russian, and realize that moaning about German grammar is just pathetic. So I keep going.I would write about my love to Arabic language, that I started learning less than a year ago, but then this entry would be too long to check (and to read, as you must be already really bored with this nonsense).Thank you for reading.P.S. Would you be so kind to check my punctuation too? I put commas almost as if I’m writing in Russian and that’s quite a lot, I think.

Two days ago I decided to make a soup. The fact is that I have some health problems so I have to pay more attention to what I eat. Liquid food is good for stomach (I mean, you need to eat something liquid from time to time to feel better).In Russia, there are two mostly popular types of soup: "borsch" (борщ) and "shee" (щи), (every housiwife knows how to make it) and there are tens of different soup recipes more, but I've decided to cook plain beef soup (with potatoes, carrots and onions) to be going on with.I can't say that I am a good cook, to say the least :) But the result was surprisingly good!Next week I'm going to cook "shee" :) And what about you?
